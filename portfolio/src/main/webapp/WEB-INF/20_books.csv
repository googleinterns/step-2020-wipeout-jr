Thatâ€™s the number of times that the word â€œmate;â€ in any of its hellish forms; is used in this book.
TWO.
HUNDRED.
AND.
TWO.
https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...
That statistic alone should be enough to justify this one star rating. If you feel satisfied enough to just remove yourself from this review; run with that feeling. Because I have; like. Seven pages of sh*t to complain about.
Thatâ€™s if Iâ€™m efficient.
And Iâ€™ve never been an efficient reviewer. Once. In my life. I counted two hundred (and two) uses of a word over seven hundred pages. That shouldnâ€™t scream â€œrational and in control of her passionate furyâ€ to you.
So buckle up; buttercup. Weâ€™ve got some categories to run through.
DISCLAIMER : This review is teeming with spoilers. It is also X-rated; due to the strength of my anger and the copious sex scenes in the source material.
I HATE THESE CHARACTERS
Rhys makes me cringe harder than Renee Zellweger in Bridget Jonesâ€™ Diary. (At least that movie has both Colin Firth and Hugh Grant to distract me from Renee viciously critiquing her own body and; like; spilling coffee all over herself or whatever.) He is capable of two actions; like a mildly impressive Ken doll: 1) sex person and 2) valiant hero trying to kill himself in the name of his friends constantly. Either he is full on f*cking Feyre (sick alliteration; Emma) or he must be actively prevented from jumping in front of poisoned weapons with the half-hearted motivation of Heroism To Save My Family (even if itâ€™s not at all clear why doing this would save them; because whatever none of the plans in this book make a lick of sense anyway).
Because; as if this book werenâ€™t fun enough; it rivals the Fast and the Furious franchise for use of the my-real-family-is-the-one-I-made-not-the-one-I-was-born-with clichÃ©.
Like Rhys; Feyre also manages to find time in her packed schedule of sex scenes and repetitive dialogue to be incredibly; incontrovertibly dumb. For example; when she traps Ianthe and ties her up or whatever; she spends an unbelievable amount of time indulging an evil-villain-revenge rant. Just enough time for her to be CAUGHT BY THE DAEMATI (a Cassandra Clare-esque douchey term that pretty much means â€œspecies of bad guy;â€ to the best of my recollection). So much of this book was me silently screaming.
Speaking of the aforementioned schedule; itâ€™s no wonder that that thing Feyre used to do called â€œpaintingâ€ is dropped like a hot potato. She never does it; but itâ€™s mentioned a handful of times in the beginning of the book. And then forgotten. And then; suddenly; almost at the merciful end of this suffering: â€œThe movement so perfect that I knew Iâ€™d one day paint it.â€ Weâ€™re still pretending that Feyre paints? Between the same diverse selection of identical sex scenes; identical training scenes; identical war discussion scenes; I donâ€™t think she has time for something so banal as a singular interest or hobby. Idk if weâ€™ll have time; I think sheâ€™ll have to get to third base with Rhys in a perfumed bath later.
At least Feyre is brave and strong; though. Which is why sheâ€™s â€œtoo tiredâ€ to do anything after a loooong day of watching other people fight in a battle; followed by Mor winnowing her home. So courageous. How does she do it.
Plus; sheâ€™s a brilliant friend. Which is why; when Morrigan confronts her for lying; leaving; making her and everyone else fear she has died and also making Mor responsible for it; Feyreâ€™s response is â€œOH YA??? WELL YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON AZRIEL.â€
Truly a depiction of a powerful woman for the ages.
And I donâ€™t get Lucienâ€™s appeal. Do we like him out of the same reason we like Draco? (Iâ€™m saying â€œweâ€ as if I like either of those characters.) Is it an omg-heâ€™s-just-trying-to-do-right-he-didnâ€™t-know-any-better type situation? Because Draco is a child trying to impress a father who doesnâ€™t love him and I still donâ€™t totally buy that. Iâ€™m still not a Draco fan. And Tamlin is not Lucienâ€™s daddy; although...maybe a more interesting book if he were.
Cassian and Azriel are both flat and boring. Amren is characterized so inconsistently that itâ€™s impossible for me to know whether I like her or not. (Iâ€™m going to say â€œnotâ€ - seems like a safer bet.) Nesta is almost cool; but the whole I Am Mean And Hard And Damaged thing goes too far. And Elain just floats around and lets things happen to her.
Morrigan; never all that interesting; now just represents the worst bisexuality rep Iâ€™ve ever read.
Itâ€™s never a good sign when youâ€™re praying for characters to die in battle just so you can catch a f*cking break.
But guess what. None of them do.
THE WRITING SUCKS; ON BOTH A COPYEDITING LEVEL AND A SUBSTANTIVE LEVEL
I truly believe that whatever team of sad sacks was assigned to copyedit this book was physically unable to attentively read it. And I cannot blame them. But it does allow for some hilarious mistakes to make it through these dull; dull pages.
Example: â€œShe did not avert her eyes from the Morrigan.â€ That pesky â€œtheâ€ makes her seem like a pro wrestler; or someone with a fun nickname; rather than the personification of the worst bi rep ever to grace young adult pages. But weâ€™ll get to that.
There are so many ellipses and dashes and italicizations and...other - ways: of breaking up the TEXT that it actually gave me motion sickness. On top of everything else this book has made me suffer through.
Maybe if a copyeditor had found the strength to make it through this book; they could have stopped the way SJM insists on using the term â€œHybern.â€ IT MEANS SO MANY THINGS. â€œHybernâ€ is used as the nomer of the evil king; the word for his people; the name of his kingdom; and the title of the land itâ€™s situated on. That is just...basic bad worldbuilding; no?
Also; a monster creature thing described as having no eyelids narrows its eyes. This inspired a fifteen minute long discussion with my roommates on whether eyes can narrow without eyelids. We came to a unanimous consensus: no; they cannot.
Also; as Val pointed out in her amazing review of this book; the words â€œvulgar gestureâ€ are used over. And over. And over again. WHAT DO THESE USES MEAN. WHY DO THEY CONSTANTLY INSPIRE LAUGHTER IN WHATEVER GLORIFIED PROP CHARACTER WHO HAPPENS TO BE NEARBY. IS THIS TACTIC SUPPOSED TO REPLACE ACTUAL JOKES OR BANTER? Because it doesnâ€™t. It just makes me angry; and also confused; which makes me even angrier.
And who thought that was even possible.
WHAT IS THIS ATTEMPT AT HIGH FANTASY LANGUAGE
Except then; yâ€™know; Rhys and Feyre and the Gang are also so hip and cool and up to date that this book uses the word â€œfuckable;â€ a word so slang-y that my laptop recognizes it as a typo for â€œsuckableâ€ or â€œfaceable;â€ whatever the hell those words are.
Otherwise; the only other remarkable attempt at making this any different from the way humans speak in 2017: the use of the word â€œmale.â€
Women are sometimes called â€œfemalesâ€ in this; but are also called women and girls and whatnot. Men; on the other hand; are absolutely only called males. Thereâ€™s an amazing moment when SJM refers to Rhys as a man; and then instantly; like; corrects herself. So it reads on the page as â€œman - male -â€
It makes no sense. I love it.
Itâ€™s truly the little things.
THE END OF THIS BOOK IS JUST A LISTING OF CLICHES
As the war weâ€™ve waited for finally arrives; and so does the time for motivational speeches and tragic goodbyes and other things that fail to make me feel something; SJM loses it entirely.
Nearly every line of dialogue in this section is just a clichÃ©; and so I will copy and paste them here; for your perusal and accompanying amusement.
â€œLeave this worldâ€¦a better place than how you found it.â€
â€œOne life may change the world.â€
â€œI believe everything happens for a reason.â€
â€œIt is the family you make; not the one you are born into; that matters.â€
â€œLight can be found even in the darkest of hells.â€
â€œThe great joy and honor of my life has been to know you.â€
â€œI wasnâ€™t sure if in the entire history of Illyria; there had ever been such a discussion.â€
So bad. And; therefore; so good.
LETâ€™S LAUGH AT DUMB THINGS
The moments when this may or may not be attempting to instill some sort of entertainment or amusement in its reader do not work at all. Luckily; we have something much better: Really dumb stuff. It is much more fun (and nourishing to the very soul; like a bowl of chicken soup - so pretty much the series of books â€œChicken Soup for the Soulâ€) to laugh at something unintentional and dumb than it is to laugh at a cheap joke. This is why the show Americaâ€™s Funniest Home Videos has been on for twenty-eight seasons; and like a thousand interchangeable bad sitcoms are canceled every year.
For example; this passage. Feyre and Rhysand are apart; blah blah blah; itâ€™s the tragedy of the century (or millennium; since these boring ass people live for infinity; because there is no justice in this world). Unsurprisingly; they use their mind control powers for a saintly motivation: sexting. Which is already so hilarious. But it gets even better; because:
â€œI sent back an image of me sticking out my tongue at him.
My clothes were back on when his answer arrived.
Like mine; it was wordless; a mere image. Like mine; Rhysandâ€™s tongue was out.
But it was occupied with doing something else.â€
I choose to interpret this statement the same way a middle schooler interprets the existence of performer Marilyn Manson based on a shady rumor he once heard about a surgery to remove three ribs. I believe that this is incontrovertible evidence that Rhysand can suck his own d*ck. WHAT ELSE COULD HE POSSIBLY BE DOING. WHAT COULD IT POSSIBLY BE OCCUPIED WITH. SJM I JUST WANNA TALK.
But just as often as I was making myself laugh by making Rhys my YA fantasy version of Marilyn Manson; I was being equally amused by seemingly innocuous lines. Like when Eris; scary villain/abuser extraordinaire; was bidding The Night Gang adieu and said; â€œSee you at the meeting in twelve days.â€ I MEAN. WHAT. WHO SPEAKS LIKE THAT. Even dialogue is just an opportunity to force an info dump. You guys; seriously: this book is so poorly written.
LETâ€™S SCREAM ABOUT DUMB THINGS
Sometimes; or most of the time depending on how you look at it; I do not want to laugh at the dumb things. Sometimes I am incapable of it; because this book is an ungodly length and so much of it is long-term stupidity.
Chapter 45; for example. Or; as I like to call it; â€œThat Meeting in Twelve Days Finally Happens.â€ Yes; this book is so boring that we are expected to anticipate an actual; literal meeting. Sure; itâ€™s a meeting between high lords to talk about war; but itâ€™s still a sit-down political discussion. And also itâ€™s just the same endless repetitive cycle of insult dialogue feat. fun moments of The Night Gang being the least convincing people on the entirety of the Earth.
Thereâ€™s an especially great moment in that adrenaline-inducing conference. For the 800 pages leading up to it; Rhys is all; â€œOk; Feyre. Listen up. Number one thing - just donâ€™t show your powers; k? Long story short the Powerful Men are going to get pissy and thenâ€¦well yâ€™know these negotiations are the most important thing to happen in hundreds of years; which I should know because Iâ€™ve been alive for that long; even though youâ€™re; what; fresh outta adolescence? Anyway just the only thing you should do is not show your powers.â€ To which Feyreâ€™s response is; â€œGot it. *shows powers instantly*â€
YES. Feyre shows her powers at the meeting!! So quickly!!! She doesnâ€™t even try all that hard; and; as promised; it almost derails the nonstop excitement of this much-anticipated civilized forum! Almost. Except then everything works out; as it always does; by Feyre saying something totally normal; 6/10 at best; and everyone being like â€œwow omg...who is this girl...she is so smart and brave and honest and we respect her so muchâ€ so that Rhys can be like â€œthatâ€™s my mate lol.â€
IRRELEVANT COMPLAINING
The only way to make the experience of reading a deeply unpleasant; extremely long book worse is to publish that book with goddamn tissue paper pages. This was like reading the Bible but without the action. And with a whole lot more smut.
Iâ€™m tucking this quote in this section too; because I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m being persnickety; but at one point; itâ€™s said that â€œOnly a madman would wield the might of his army just to get revenge on three women.â€ And my question is; why use the word â€œwomenâ€? Why not â€œpeopleâ€? Is it more insane if itâ€™s women? Why is that? TELL ME WHY. REALLY I JUST WANNA TALK.
PLOTLINE? WHAT PLOTLINE
This book is just...so boring.
There are countless info dumps; which; I mean. Thereâ€™s no excuse for that in a third book. This was going to be the last book in the series; when there was still hope in the world and I prayed that somehow SJM actually was writing these books for some sort of artistic fulfillment rather than money. How; I ask you; would there still be so much sh*tty worldbuilding in the last book in a series?
OH YES; THIS BOOK IS DEFINITELY WOKE AND NOT THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF THAT ENTIRELY
SJM has been getting a lot of sh*t lately for her white/straight/cis narratives. So itâ€™s no surprise that she would try to get those pesky activists off her back this time. Unfortunately; she does a remarkably bad job.
This book is all straight people except for LGBT+ relationships based on sex alone; or in an unequal relationship wherein one person has authority over another. (Examples: a high lord whose bisexuality extends purely to the fact that heâ€™s into threesomes; a military captain dating his high lord/commander/boss.)
Plus; thereâ€™s bisexuality rep so terrible it took me hours to make it through a handful of pages. But that gets a category of its own.
I also shouldnâ€™t be surprised at the redemption of abusers in this book. Because Tamlin; in ACOTAR; was just a Nice Guy. Fine. But the fangirls loved a certain bad boy guest star with purple eyes. So; instead of creating a love triangle or transitioning between love interests like a normal person; SJM made him into an actual abuser. A villain.
Thatâ€™s also fine. But you canâ€™t just redeem him like you could redeem the unloved side of a love triangle. Because you made him into a genuinely bad person.
Unfortunately; SJM must have missed that memo. She must have missed it three times; actually; because Eris also gets redemption (and a throne!). As does his enabler brother; Lucien. Wonderful. Abuse apologists for the win.
But this book is totally; definitely feminist; right??? I mean; female protagonist! War plotline! It must be; by default! So when Cassian says â€œI told you that the moment we started letting females into our group; theyâ€™d be nothing but troubleâ€; and woke king Rhys responds; â€œYou actually said you needed a reprieve from staring at our ugly faces; and that some ladies would add some much needed prettiness for you to look at all day.â€ itâ€™s totally fine!
So itâ€™s an utter shock that this narrative also lives nearly entirely within the bounds of gender roles. Reading about men (Rhys; Cassian; Azriel; all the high lords) fighting in battle while the women (Feyre; Mor; Elain; Nesta; Cresseida) watch and tend to the wounded later is so refreshing. Doesnâ€™t make me want to blow my brains out at all.
And no; Mor being assigned to babysit Feyre later on; only heading into battle because Feyre tricks her into fighting so she can sneak away does not make it better; thanks.
This is definitely; certainly the feminist YA fantasy youâ€™ve been waiting for; folks.
THE WORST BI REP EVER TO HIT THE SHELVES; WHICH IS INSANE BECAUSE WHEN IS THERE E V E R GOOD BI REP
But I havenâ€™t mentioned the most unforgivable thing yet. The thing that made this book my first SJM one-star; after giving every other book Iâ€™ve read by her two stars. The thing that actually made me feel real hatred and fury and; worst of all; sadness.
Truly; the worst bisexual representation I have ever read comes in the final chapters of this book. Iâ€™ve read a lot of bad bisexual rep. And itâ€™s endlessly upsetting. But none of it felt quite like this.
Apparently; Sarah J. Maas decided in the third book that she wanted to stop getting sh*t for her heteronormativity. So she decided to take a character who had been established as straight; and make her bi.
So she took this character; Morrigan. She makes Morrigan cry. She writes Morriganâ€™s impassioned speech to Feyre. This is Morriganâ€™s coming out; for the first time. Morrigan says that she prefers women. To the point that she is only capable of feeling romantic love for a women.
But occasionally; she will force herself to sleep with a man. In order â€œto keep people from looking too closely.â€ Instead of telling the man who has been in love with her for centuries that she doesnâ€™t love him back; wonâ€™t ever love him back; she forces herself to sleep with men when heâ€™ll know that sheâ€™s done it; so that she still seems straight but heâ€™ll know she doesnâ€™t love him.
And the author dubs it bisexuality.
I hate that she felt entitled to use this underrepresented; misunderstood sexuality as a playing piece in her own quest to be well-liked. I hate that the hundreds of thousands of people who read this book have been given this depiction of bisexuality. And I hate that Sarah J. Maas will keep writing wildly successful books. Books in this very series; depicting this character in this way and calling it â€œbisexuality.â€
Itâ€™s unfair. Itâ€™s awful. And I am never; never; never going to forget that it happened.
Bottom line: I didnâ€™t expect to like this book. But I also didnâ€™t expect it would become one of my least favorite books Iâ€™ve ever read.
----
pre-review
I did it.
Everyone told me I couldn't do it. Just DNF it; they said. You're being insane; they said. Why would you force yourself through 700 pages of misery? Actually; didn't you hate the second book? Why did you even pick up the third book; you f*cking fool?
And you know what? They were right; because that was stupid.
But also THEY WERE WRONG; because I FINISHED THIS GODDAMN NIGHTMARE OF A NOVEL.
It may have taken me eight months. But it's over.

 full disclosure there will be so many bad vibes around this review; it's like in the prisoner of azkaban youâ€™ll need to charge all the negativity away with a stag bc there's just so much salt and bitterness seeping through my follicles I'm literally just a bottomless pit of negativity right now.
*raises my arms to sensually embrace the metaphorical shower of said salt and bitterness*
âš  also before y'all come for me please consider I've been through some stuff...for example I've had to get out of bed for several hours every day this week
âš  UNMARKED SPOILERS because I am a lazy shit I guess
____________________________
Aaah. When you remain stubbornly indifferent towards a book that everyone else loves and you feel like the unlikely hero in high school movies being pelted with dodgeballs!! feels bad; pal. Especially when I can remember an exact moment in time where I thought with all my heart i could never hate this series and well... I proved her wrong.
I had so many expectations man; now I really wish I could get a refund for all the love and money that Iâ€™ve wasted like!!!! please repay my emotional and financial labour!!!!
Anyway; Iâ€™ve been putting off this review for so long and you know when you bottle it all up and then it inevitably explodes that's me today; sorry about the mess (literally bc this review is a mess y'all) I mean I'll get over all of this eventually but let!! me!! be!! salty!! first!!
â— alright let's start with the plot; shall we
â— the first 60% was just a filler tbh; you just kinda have to endure it until the storyline gets some plot relevance back
â— and when it does; you'll find out that your will to read anything has been leeched out drop by drop
â— like you know when you suddenly become aware that you really don't like what youâ€™re reading but you can't stop and it's like this loud noise in your head drowning out any attempt your brain makes to not be annoying?? uhuh
â— everything was just so meh and terrible; and i'm not even talking about the artful suffering you can write poems about I was just really fucking bored!!!!!
â— I skimmed entire pages and tbh I wasn't even trying my hardest lol but like I said; I was very very bored which I think should be taken into consideration
â— I mean?? there's just so much fucking NOTHING one can take before they decide they'd be more happy to be available for hire if anyone wants to watch grass grow or something
â— the only time i expressed any kind of emotions is when THAT GODDAMN SURIEL died and that emotion was called Being A Very Spiteful Angry Bitch like i'm not really that angry of a person but THERE WAS LITERALLY NO REASON FOR THAT??
â— also can someone explain how this goddamn magic system works??
â— the whole thing is so badly constructed and so inconsistent like give me a damn coherent plot
â— so each high lord has their own specific power?? and then the power manifests in their heir?? then why is rhysand the most powerful high lord if his power is inherited?? are the night court high lords always the most powerful or??
â— also why did feyre steal the powers when she was resurrected but rhysand didn't??
â— and if nesta stole death from that damn cauldron thing then logically would no one be able to die lol??
â— anyway; I don't even give a shit anymore lmao
â—
â— ok so as I was saying I have not had fun once reading this book ever
â— wait ok that's not entirely true
â— it was great at the very beginning with feyre and her â€œi'm happy to see tamtool suffer and also i'm actively being pettyâ€ vibes
â— man I was sitting at the edge of my chair; alert and ready!! like who doesn't love being petty and childish to people whom have wronged them?? not!!me!!
â— & how she seemed to embrace her inner meryl streep; that performance in lucien's bedroom deserves 10 nominations
â— too bad she's such a mary sue with her unlimited powers bullshit...bla bla booooooriiiiiiiiiiiing
â— and Iâ€™m not gonna lie; this book nearly scored some points when they unleashed those underworld gods (yeah the bone carver/his twin sister/and that scary shadowy thing were really fucking cool)
â— but then sjm just killed them off.. great
â— another funny thing; Elain managed so easily to stab the king of hybern and finish him off but those ancient creatures went down faster than you can say mmmkay
â— lmao give me a fucking break
â— speaking of the king
â— at what point did the mighty king of hybern embrace the role of a fucking Disney villain
â— lbr; king of hybern sounds a lot like a fucking joke if you pronounce it â€a fucking jokeâ€™
â— like are you really gonna tell me that is what a villain looks like?? are you really gonna lie to my face like that?? lame
â— I am so done honestly I just wish that at the end of everything; the cauldron would have just taken pity on all off them and vore Prythian or something
â— it's not like I want all of them to die (Iâ€™m not that morbid) but I have standards...winning a war in the cheesiest and fucking lamest way you could possibly imagine is not something I am ok with
â— the writing
â— you know when you try and squeeze a blackhead but get waaay over enthusiastic and end up making a huge scab in the middle of your face and it's all your own fault you've destroyed everything?? thatâ€™s how sjm writes
â— my skills literally include reading entire pages without absorbing a single thing
â— and getting super annoyed with the lack of question marks and inexplicable........ amounts.......of....... ellip.....ses............
â— which leads us to another favorite topic of mine
â— THE SMUT/ROMANCE WHATEVER
â— hoo boY HOOO BOY!!!
â— velvet softness is the new velvet wrapped steel; lads
â— SO MUCH CRINGY SMUT and it's a little like when cats bring you back a dead mouse as a present beacuse they think it's a nice gesture
â— uuhh... it sure as fuck was not
â— in fact reading that was literally like being run over very slowly by a steam roller so you can feel every inch of you being pulped personally into the ground
â— thanks for turning me off herero sex forever I guess
â— I'm not even being dramatic this time; it was legit so bad that with every passing page; I've become more and more convinced that I have died and was atoning for my sins in hell
â— I mean I'm sure sex is nice but you know what's even nicer??
â— that lowkey intimacy where you just lie in silence and stroke each others hair and be near
â— like br0S you're not defined by your genitals you paint your future with your actions starting with THAT GODDAMN WAR YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO STRATEGISE FOR????
â— at least don'T DO IT IN THAT GODDAMN LIBRARY??????
â— that's when I lost all my respect for feysand; Iâ€™m literally inconsolable what have you Done!!!!
â— and just please no more ""feasting""!!!!!!!!
â— I would rather someone spit on me than say they'd like to devour/feast on me or make my toes curl like?? JESUS FUCKING CHRIST???
â— who has a car??? I will pay you $50 to run me over
â— remember when sex in YA used to be like something along the lines of â€œi didn't know where he ended and i begunâ€?? I want to go back tbh this has nothing to offer other than the indelible desire to wash my goddamn brain out with bleach
â— seriously though...i was literally so scared i would turn the page and find more cringy sex i just couldn't go through that again i'm not strong enough
â— anyway
â— moving on
â— another one of my favorite topics
â— The M*te Word
â— ""let me repay you for last night; mate""
â— I DIDNT KNOW RHYSAND WAS AUSTRALIAN????
â— no listen
â— if I ever hear the word â€œm*teâ€ (shoved into a romantic context) ever again; just know that Iâ€™m half of a quarter of a fourth of an inch from a serious breakdown and if you hear me whispering â€œpleasestopnoâ€ take a few steps back because this bitch is about to blow and itâ€™s not going to be pretty
â— like I'm not kidding every time (which is 90% of the time I swear) the m word was used a piece of my soul crumbls wearily to the dust
â— and tbh I hate the entire concept of mates in these books bc a) no one is entitled to any part of you; and b) pls stop romantisizing that. how terrifying is it thinking how many loud eaters are out there??? like what if that was your lot and you were stuck without a say??? what if your ""m*te"" is someone who feels weird about you putting your feet on the table???
â— how about piss off
â— RHYSAND
â— look
â— I'm willing to suspend disbelief and read a book where the whole thing is a character study of a terrible terrible man who does terrible terrible things before I'm willing to read about how just goddamn Perfect rhysand is
â— lbr; the entire point of having rhysand there is for the readers to drown themselves in romanticized idealizations lmao
â— he has literally zero flaws except maybe occasionally causing earthquakes but that's just bc of how fuckign powerful his sperm is *chokes on own vomit and dies*
â— and tbh I blame these kind of books for making me expect men to be dynamic instead of the boring and underdeveloped flavor most of them come in
â— let's just keep it realistic
â— also he can choke for bargaining with mor's abusive family and for belittling her feelings when she was obviously upset
â— that was a dick move
â— you know who's next!!!
â— TAMTOOL
â— oh tammy... you know thereâ€™s a word for people who are so selfish they can't see beyond the walls of their own pettiness; and that word; is motherfuckingsonofabitch
â— that's YOU; dummy tammy!!!
â— well it already seems unanimous that tamlin is a disgusting heathen of a man (and has been since acomaf)
â— i'll give sjm credits for not normalising a man's anger (i'm just so over the genre of litterature where somebody's bad temper is considered a fucking turn on; like please leave)
â— yeah ok... maybe tamlin really didn't start with the intention of making feyre feel uncomfortable but maybe if he tried thinking of women as human beings it would help as a guide line :))))
â— nothing much changed in acowar tbh; sjm talked about a redemption arc for him but the only way for tamlin to redeem himself at this point is by drinking heavily to smother the shame of what his life has become and die of liver failure
â— bc boooy; was tamlin in acowar somehow even WORSE than the tamlin in acomaf
â— like yeah saving feyre and allying with them doens't count; bro
â— also ""be happy""??? DONT TELL HER WHAT TO BE YOU BITCh!!! IF SHE WANTS TO BURN WITH THE THOUSAND FIRES OF HER SPITE THEN SHE WILL BURN WITH THE THOUSAND FIRES OF HER SPITE
â— ""be happy""; my ass
â— how about YOU APOLOGISE FOR BEING A SHIT??
â— how about actually showing a shred of remorse for being an abusive asshole????
â— he literally called feyre a slut and completely ignored lucien
â— i hope he gets a blow job by a thousand angry suriels I AM SO FUCKING PISSED
â— like IDK ABOUT YALL but how is this a redemption arc??? the fuck.......
â— *exhales*
â— may i ask for a moment of silence for the sake of
â— the tear of utter salt that mists my eye whenever i think of what this book did to amren
â— amren in acomaf was this badass unknown creature who had no real responsibilities besides putting god's fear in people and drinking A-class blood
â— but as it turns out; everything good was fake; i wanted her to wreak havoc; i wanted her to morph into her true calamitous self; i wanted a fucking dragon companion....
â—..... but Yet Again I Was Let Down
â— also i was so pissed off that everyone was snapping at her just bc she refuses to sugarcoat things??? her opinion is her damn opinion??? she can literally kill y'all??
â— i love how she was like ""listen i've saved your asses; i get to say whatever the fuck i want""
â— i support you
â— AND DOn't even get me started on varian; IM SORRY BUT WHERE THE FUCK DID HE COME FROM???
â— that was so random??
â— just as random as lucien's father?? where's the fucking build up??
â— also why DOES EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER NEED TO BE PAIRED OFF WITH SOMEONE?? iâ€™ve went like 18 years without a love interest and i just wanna take a hot second and thank god for how that worked out for me
â— anyway i love amren and i just wish we could tie our intestines together to make a ladder so we can climb out of this window of cheese and sappiness that was acowar and go live in the ocean or something
â—
â— alright now listen; i've always liked mor
â— my heart hurt for the way she felt worthless bc of her parents' opinions of her
â— like i just wanted to hold her and assure her that their fucking duty as the ones who actually forced her into this world is to love her unconditionally and not doing so reflects their own failings not hers
â— but i also wanna tell her that inaction and avoidance can be just as dangerous as cruel intentions
â— and azriel was worth more than second thoughts and maybes
â— and anyway; any relationship that could be â€œdestroyedâ€ by having a conversation about feelings or expectations wasnâ€™t really firm enough anyway; so there isnâ€™t much to destroy tbh
â— like i was so here to watch her see walk that thin line between not changing yourself for someone else and also taking responsibility for your silences and inactions when they hurt you and the ppl around you
â— but tbh i don't even think i'll continue with this series; i run out of fucks to give about these characters or this plot or anything like dhfjskfjhg there was a time when i was so obsessed with everything acotar related; now i'm lie

In the best possible way (because Iâ€™m thrilled to cry for a day straight? Idk). First of all; the scope of this story is extraordinary. Events from the first half that seemed so important at the time now feel like minuscule details in the face of this EPIC PLOT.
I love how Maas writes such complex characters who have had their lives shattered in a variety of ways; yet still keep fighting for each other and work to create a new life with the family they chose. Feyreâ€™s growth from the first book where she had such low self-worth is beyond inspirational as she finds the ability to completely forgive & love herself and everything sheâ€™s been. Sheâ€™s still a flawed character who makes some sketchy calls and is continually healing. And that's what I love most about this book: every single character is broken and healing. Lucien; Elain; Nesta; Cassian; Azriel; Mor; Rhys; Amren; even Tamlin. EVERYONE. And the amount they care about each other is just
Maas manages to juggle a wide range of characters in this book; add in even more; and find really creative ways to show whatâ€™s happening with other ships besides Rhys & Feyre. I think if you look at this as just a conclusion to the trilogy then a lot of storylines are kind of underwhelming because it's mostly setting up potential for future books with a lot of the side characters. But I was just excited for any page time for Cassian; Nesta; Elain; and Azriel!
I also loved how everyone finds a different way to be strong (like in ways besides brute strength) and the story actually shows the horrors of war without romanticizing basic killing. Thereâ€™s a theme of the choices & consequences of war and how one life can change the world:
â€what we think to be our greatest weakness can sometimes be our biggest strength. Andâ€¦ the most unlikely person can alter the course of history.â€
I was curious to see how Feyre would wield her new power as High Lady on her own rather than through Rhys. A lot of stories find ways to keep couples separated until the very end so you never really see them figure out how they work together; so I thought the scenes with Rhys & Feyre just talking helped everything SO much. Thereâ€™s a running thread throughout the story that Rhys would rather sacrifice himself than let others be hurt and EVERYTHING GETS SO EMOTIONAL omg.
Other random parts I loved:
- CASSIAN. My phone now autocorrects his name to caps lock if thatâ€™s any indication of my love. His entrance was beyond epic.
- finally getting to see so many details of the other Courts! I NEED FAN ART
- the Winter Court has armored polar bears and wee fox messengers with vests omg
- characters who have the ability to be more than the bad decisions they made in the past (while still not excusing those actions)
- references like the Myrmidons; Ouroboros; the Illyrians; Stryga; Koschei; Thesan; Eris; Lord Thanatos; Madja; the Firebird + Vassa; Andromache; and so many others! Maas wove in references to Russian folk tales; Bible stories; elements of Greek mythology; and various myths from around the world in such clever ways that I was geeking out the whole time.
- so many plot points came full circle or were repeated in really neat ways
- Lucienâ€™s story
- ALL OF THE SASS AND BANTER
- I never thought Iâ€™d be this emotional about the Weaver; the Bone Carver; or the Surielâ€¦
- seeing Cassian in action commanding troops as the general
- serious LOTR vibes with their Council of Elrond drama & hobbit-like Autumn Court
- Elain reminded me of Eowyn in the Houses of Healing (andâ€¦ certain other moments)
- Rhys shows Feyre the library he turned into a refuge for women recovering from abuse and itâ€™s more than a side comment â€” like Mor and Rhys genuinely care for their mental health and also seek refuge there themselves
- Actual healthy relationships. Rhys treats Feyre as an equal: â€the male who had always presented me with a choice not as a gift; but as my own gods-given right.â€
- THAT WHOLE BATTLE AT THE END. I am still not ok.
I wasnâ€™t too sure about the first 10% thoughâ€¦ Feyre had to explain every single action she took at the Spring Court so the reader couldnâ€™t misconstrue her actions; which got to be a little drawn out. Another minor problem for me was that we're constantly told how awesomely powerful Rhysand is aaaaand I wanted to actually SEE more of him misting giant chunks of armies. Sure; it was a clever plot device to have everyone's powers limited for most of the story... but all of that stuff in ACOMAF about how powerful everyone is and how ""Mor is who I'll call in when the armies fail and Cassian and Azriel are both dead"" didn't really come through here.
I was nervous about how this story would end since weâ€™ve never seen Maas finish a storyline before; but I feel like she wrapped up everything really well while still making it clear where the following books could continue! Basically; this world means SO much to me and Iâ€™m really happy with how everything ended. Yay.
____________________________________
Now for some points that I really do want to hear some input on:
I think Maas listened to her readers and made a serious effort to make this book more diverse overall. There are fae of every race in every rank now; there are several gay couples with new characters (one of whom is a High Lord); another High Lord whoâ€™s either bisexual or pansexual; and a major character is gay. Maas also clarifies that Amren; the Illyrians; and a lot of other characters are definitely not white or simply â€œtan.â€ And I know Morâ€™s story didnâ€™t work for some readers; but Iâ€™ve also seen others who are absolutely thrilled. So I guess I'm hoping to hear more discussion about what did or didnâ€™t work for everyone.
I'll point out a few parts I have seen criticism on so far: in the beginning; the niece and nephew of Hybern appear and arenâ€™t interested in Iantheâ€™s advances so Feyre observes that â€œperhaps any sort of physical passion had long ago been drained away; alongside their souls.â€ That sentence angered a lot of people in the book community and was apparently seen as a comment against asexuality. Thereâ€™s another part later where Feyre thinks â€œthe two of them perhaps preferred no oneâ€™s company but each otherâ€™s. In whatever unholy capacity.â€ I guess I personally thought she meant incest instead of shaming asexuals; but itâ€™s the center of a lot of discussion right now.
If there is something harmful in a book; I do think the author should be held accountable and people shouldn't excuse it. So; yes; I will acknowledge some problematic aspects of this series and I am in no way attempting to overlook them or blindly excuse whatever a favorite author does. But I am absolutely still giving this book 5 stars; largely because of the extremely positive rep for PTSD; surviving trauma & abuse; and rebuilding yourself. I have never seen an author write such realistic; relatable; and inspirational character arcs in this area as Maas â€“ Iâ€™ve heard from hundreds of readers throughout the past year who say that her books quite literally saved their lives. That... is HUGE. The positive impact her books have had on so many young women is seriously incredible (even if itâ€™s just making them think critically about how men treat them). Sometimes it seems like people scrutinize every single sentence Maas writes on a much more vindictive level with the sole aim of pointing out her faults; so I want to clarify that there is an actual; important reason why I gave this 5 stars besides general fangirling squeals.
I really donâ€™t feel the need to explain why I relate so strongly to these broken characters; but I did at least cover some of my current physical health situation in my review of Empire of Storms. Iâ€™m still struggling to survive day to day; contrary to whatever illusion social media creates. I can't even try to explain the exhausting physical battle; but will say that the mental endurance is a whole other challenge. So to find this family of characters who have been through hell physically and mentally; yet still manage to find hope; love; and fight to survive is more powerful than I can possibly say. These books and characters have been a total lifeline for me (and so many others) and I will always be grateful to Maas for them. So maybe pause before you judge me as a wealthy white girl with a super easy life who blindly supports anything Maas writes out of clueless privilege.
Iâ€™ve never denied any faults in these books. But I AM asking that people stop dismissing all of the positive representation for others as not only unimportant; but something to viciously attack those readers for finding. Most of the bloggers I follow who are strong diversity advocates gave Everything; Everything 5 stars for its diversity despite what I found to be hurtful ableism. It never once crossed my mind to disown them as â€œwrongâ€ because I know rating books is complex and reflects our own individual experience with a story.
And just because I identified so strongly with the positive rep doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m ok with the rep that didnâ€™t work as well. (Ex: I personally wasn't huge on how yet another bisexual character wants to sleep with literally everyone they see). My 5 star rating is not trying to brush those parts aside; imply that the problems in this book werenâ€™t as important as the parts I liked; or to overlook any issues. I struggled with this rating; but in the end the amount that this book has helped me and so many readers I know is overwhelming.
And I genuinely do hope that there can be a respectful discussion in the comments because Iâ€™m curious how others experienced the same story. If I missed some problems that really stood out to you; I genuinely want to hear about it.
Thank you to the wonderful Brittney for texting me nonstop while reading and surviving this with me â€“ here's her review. (less)",3,NEXTBOOK

""Rhys stepped off the stairs and took my hand.
Night Triumphantâ€”and the Stars Eternal.
If he was the sweet; terrifying darkness; I was the glittering light that only his shadows could make clear.""
It's the worst feeling in the world when finales don't match up to their predecessors. I liked A Court of Thorns and Roses; I loved A Court of Mist and Fury; I am frankly disappointed by A Court of Wings and Ruin.
First; the writing. It's in desperate need of another round of editing. It's unpolished; full of unnecessary repetition and lazy placeholder sentences.
Maas can write. She's proved it over and over again; which makes ACOWAR seem almost criminal. I think the strain of writing two novels a year finally caught up with her. ACOTAR AND ACOMAF don't really count because they were written long before Throne of Glass was published. All she had to do was clean up. But ACOWAR was written back-to-back with Empire of Storms; which was a beefy number on its own.
Fervent as I was for ACOWAR; I wouldn't have minded waiting another year if it meant getting quality content.
Second is the ending.
(view spoiler)
Another thing that bothered me is how unbelievably powerful Feyre is. There is feminism; which is an underlying theme for her character; and there is what-the-fuckery. Near the beginning of the book; she is able to take on two daemati (powerful fae) who have a thousand years of fighting experience over her. Later; after she accidentally ingests a drug that strips her of her powers; they still magically flare back to life to help her triumph over two seasoned High Fae fighters.
Right; I think I've bitched enough about the bad. Let's get to the good.
I love the characters. The Inner Circle; Lucien; Nesta; Elain... they are a huge part why I rated ACOWAR as high as it is. Feyre and Rhysâ€”in this book and this book onlyâ€”aren't as interesting. Their story in terms of conflict was finished in ACOMAF and although I enjoy how Maas explores how normal couples argue and make up; I'm not as invested in them as before. There are too many other stories begging to be told: Lucien's; Elain's; Nesta and Cassian's; Mor's; Tamlin's.
Yes; Tamlin. This fandom is too hard on himâ€”and too forgiving of Rhys. I will never forget what he did in ACOTAR. Yet because the story is filtered through Feyre's perspective; Rhys becomes a hero who makes mistakes and Tamlin becomes a monster who commits unforgivable sins. He genuinely thought the woman he loved had been abducted and was likely being tortured. I'm not excusing his abusive behavior; but we have to remember he was suffering from PTSD too. He was trying to protect Feyre the best he couldâ€”just like Rhys by forcing Feyre to make that bargain with him way back in ACOTAR; fyi. Why does Rhys deserve dozens of free passes and not Tamlin? Hating the High Lord of Spring just because Feyre does is a disservice to the complexity of his character.
I also like that Maas seems to be pulling away from the whole ""mates"" concept. Multiple characters within have strong romantic relationships without the mating bond; and those that do may not necessarily be right for each other. (view spoiler)
The pacing is good; too. There aren't as many sex scenes as the previous book; which I was happy about; though not due to any misguided sense of propriety. I simply found myself bored reading about Rhys slamming his shaft up to the hilt or what not. (view spoiler) While I liked them in ACOMAF; there are more important things going on here; like the war or the other courts.
Final verdict? Bring on the spin-offs.

After thinking A Court of Mist and Fury was such a huge improvement from A Court of Thorns and Roses; I was really excited for this third installment. I even preordered it. But I really struggled to get into the book from the very start. From pacing issues to awkward sex scenes that did nothing for me; it was one disappointment after another.
I've said this before but I really dislike Maas's sex scenes. At her best; she writes them strangely with words like ""branding"" and ""claiming""; but here they were just plain icky. With all the talk of ""mates""; ""growling"" and ""purring""; and the climaxing from stroking one another's wings; I felt like I'd walked in on two animals rutting in the mud. Ugh.
And another thing-- Feyre and Rhysand are already mated and loved up to their eyeballs so there was no sexual tension; no will they/won't they; which made the sex scenes so boring.
What's strange about these sex scenes is how they manage to somehow be both graphic and coy at the same time. Maas never actually uses explicit words. If a young kid picked up this book; they might assume Rhysand and Feyre were dancing or playing an instrument.
His touch turned different. Exploring. Broad strokes and feather-light ones; arches and swirls and direct; searing lines.
And her vagina is usually described as ""there"" or ""where I want him"". Then; at the same time; these scenes are weirdly overwritten; with her orgasm (obviously not called that) leaving her â€œskin glowing like a newborn star in its wakeâ€. It's just really not my thing.
I was disappointed with the writing in general; to be honest. Maas seemed to write a lot more ""tell"" and a lot less ""show"" than usual. I was especially disappointed at the wasted opportunity for some underhanded manipulation in the first part. After how the last book ended; Feyre was kind of ""undercover"" at the start and in a position for lies and sneakiness. Except it was mostly her swanning around and quietly seething to herself about how much she hated Ianthe and how much of a douche Tamlin is. I thought this whole part was boring when it should have been extremely tense and exciting.
But I think the worst thing was the overall pacing. It's a long book; but I can normally sprint through Maas's works in a day; yet here it was such a slog. Especially the first half. It's taken up with a lot of character conversations and strategizing for the upcoming war with Hybern. It lacked a pull; a sense of urgency; some kind of tension to make me need to know what happens next.
I cannot believe they've announced another four books for this series. Why??? I can only hope they are some kind of spin-off series because; otherwise; either a) we will have to suffer through who the fuck knows how many more awkward; unsexy Feyre/Rhysand sex scenes; or b) Maas will destroy Rhys's character and hook Feyre up with yet another hot fae dude. I'm not sure which is more likely.
The later chapters of this book picked up in pacing; but I think it was too little; too late. This is a whopping 700-page monster and it obviously didn't need to be. I will say that I liked how things were left with Tamlin; but seeing as that part was only a few sentences long; it doesn't make up for everything else.
I'm thinking this is where I drop out of this series.

Because a Court of Wings and Ruin was the BEST CONCLUSION I could ever hope for.
I want to shout THANK YOU SJM for this incredible adventure. Thank you for letting us dream and travel across the stars if only for a short time.
I have been a massive fan of the ACOTAR series since the first book so I was highly anticipating ACOWAR. I was afraid I wouldnâ€™t like the third book as much as I loved the second one but hell; I was so wrong. I swear; I don't know how many nerve cells this book cost me.
Not only is the book thrilling and well-written. But it added a lot more complexity than I'd expected. Both in the characters and the plot. The progression brings about so many new faces (Have five to Helion; my second favourite High Lord); each of them unique in their own way.
When Feyre was in the Spring Court; she was so over-powered like she is a goodness and no one can stop her - I was getting some unwanted Aelinâ€™s vibe here â€“ but the plot was pretty well-driven after that; allowing each character to have its share of glory in Hybern Battle. And thank god for incredible plot twists or else I would have died a thousand times.
The other thing that I really enjoyed is the fact that the book was unpredictable. I got all emotional because the story has a way of being built up and simply torn down piece by piece by a certain event and you are like â€œWhat the hell just happened?â€ and then being rebuilt once again.
I literally went mental in one of the last scene â€“ YES; THIS SCENE â€“ my parents were actually concerned because of my change of emotions. I cried during the emotional moments; I got stressed during the battle scenes; I laughed so hard in others; I blushed during the bold sexy scenes; but most of all; I had â€“ and still have believe me - embarrassing fangirling moments over the characters.
I have a lot of favourite scenes. Like a lot especially those where a potential couple interact â€“ You should have seen me during NESSIAN SCENES; I was a FANGIRL MONSTER â€“ but one scene particular brought me to tear and that was RHYSâ€™s SPEECH BEFORE the FINAL BATTLE.
Overall; it was an EPIC BOOK closing an AMAZING trilogy with immensely ENTERTAINING STORYLINE; characters TO LOVE and a DETAILED fantasy WORLD.
Very much worth your time.

OMG!THIS BOOK!I LOVED IT SO MUCH! AND IT MADE ME CRY! THE FEELS!
I'm NOT even going to hint at any spoilers or go into too much in the book because there are a million people reading it right now.
I must say I loved A Court Of Mist And Fury as my favorite and now this one is my new favorite.
I love Rhys; Feyre; Cassian; Azriel; Lucien; Nesta; Elain; Mor; Amren and some random others.
They all have to fight in the war; trying to defeat King Hybern who is evil to the core. I won't tell you what happened there but it's amaze balls.
Tamlin also did one thing that made me happy. All is forgiven for now with something that he did.
Feyre's sisters; Nesta and Elain are trying to make their life with Feyre and what they are now. It was hard to read but things somewhat settled in.
I think there are some more love interests coming up. I really hope so.
The war and things were brutal and bloody and I thought we were going to lose some so many times. There were some loses and that's all I'm going to say.
Feyre and Rhysand's love is so powerful and strong and wonderful; it makes my heart ache. And when . . . I can't even.
There were revelations about certain things and certain people. There was love and loss and forgiveness and hatred. I think this book covered them all.
I love this book so very much! I'm so happy with what has happened so far but I'm terrified that there is going to be three more books. Who will die? Will anyone? I can't take it! And I'm also excited to have three more books. *Sob* I don't know.
If you love this series so far then you will love this book!

Initially I was so wrapped up in needing closure to this part of the story that I was grabby grabby for anything I could get my hands on; but I canâ€™t stop thinking about how many issues I had with this book. Was it enjoyable? Sure! I loved jumping back in with my old friends and seeing what was going on; but after a very lengthy intro I found it wasnâ€™t quite what I had hoped for.
I wonâ€™t rehash everything in detail; there are enough reviews that have already done a much better job than I can; but I feel itâ€™s worth noting them all the same. The tedious pacing; the lack of tension (and lets be honest action as well); along with the awkward; singular attempt at diversity; I just canâ€™t give it more than 3 stars.

No; I donâ€™t. Good kids.
â€œYou High Lords really do love your melodrama; donâ€™t you?â€
(As if I hadn't enough ammo already.)
For honesty's sake; the last two thirds of the book I could only bring myself to skim through (and I'm quite proud of myself for managing even that). The first third had accurately enlightened me as to what I was to expect; and my (abysmally low) expectations were met point by point.
We girls of the SmutClub weren't able to do a proper buddy read as we did last year with ACoMaF due to real life kicking our asses; however; I'm sure you don't want to miss Sarah's and Reyes's reviews; and Emer's call for honesty and good sense when it comes to the target market of this series (and of the Throne of Glass series too; at this point) perfectly highlights a problem I haven't been able to wrap my mind around since it first arose.
â€¢First of all; I'd like to take a moment to answer a question that no one asked but that I think it fair to take into account nonetheless; said question being; ""If you evidently don't like Maas's books; why do you keep reading them?""
Very good point indeed.
I used to consider her books a guilty pleasure until; well; yesterday. The word ""pleasure"" in that expression; though; baffled me very much even before. More correctly; reading her was an experience akin to getting your first period at school and noticing too late (mortally embarrassing); while ranting about it later was a honest if inclement exercise in snark; just as reading other people's reviews with previous knowledge of the book was pure amusement; be them positive or negative; and this latter reason is probably what always convinced me to suffer a little for the greater fun. Sometimes I also enjoyed some parts; so mine wasn't all sadism; after all. But A Court of Wings and Ruin? (I still have no clue about what this absurd title is supposed to mean.) This one was sheer torture. A bore. Like having a pitchfork repeatedly shoved in the eyeballs.
(I should refer you to my review of A Court of Mist and Fury; which already contains many; if not all; of the issues I had with this final instalment too; because since I've read that book with way more attention than I did ACoWaR; you'd probably find that one more specific and generally accurate.)
â€¢The writing gets worse. It's a miracle -or whatever its opposite would be called. Saying that it's melodramatic doesn't begin to describe it anymore; admitting that its basic rule is emotional manipulation would be such and understatement; my fingers itch. Everything is amplified; everything is exaggerated; everything makes twice the noise that it should make proportionally to its dimensions. Which is to say; everything becomes grotesque. Ridiculousness abounds; especially when matters of the heart (you have no idea how much I struggled not to use some other word that would have been more fit to the case at hand there) are concerned. I'll make just two quick examples both taken from chapter 14. The examples may contain mild spoilers.
â€œWhere are my sisters?â€ The thought clanged through me; jarring as a pealing bell.
Rhys paused; hand slipping from my hair as his smile faded. â€œAt the House of Wind.â€ He straightened; swallowingâ€”as if it somehow checked him. â€œI canâ€”take you to them.â€ Every word seemed to be an effort.
But he would; I realized. Heâ€™d shove down his need for me and take me to them; if that was what I wanted. My choice. It had always been my choice with him.â€
To spell it out; what Feyre's voice is implying here is that one point in the never-ending list of reasons why Rhysand is worth worshipping is that he is able to keep it in his pants ten minutes longer so that she can go say hello to her sisters; whom she hasn't seen in more than a month and who; last she saw them; had just undergone a devastating trauma. It is evident that Maas is still shoving in our faces that we must absolutely love Rhysand... a pity she is still picking all the wrong reasons; because what I think when I read a scene like this is ""Someone please lock him away"" (and I'm being kind).
Example number two (trigger warning: this one's rather disgusting. I for sure gagged once or twice.); this one to show what I mean by ""overwritten"" and ""grotesque"" and ""ew"":
â€œYou have a choice;â€ he murmured against my cheekbone. â€œEither I lick every inch of you clean â€¦â€ His hand grazed the tip of my breast; circling lazily. As if we had days and days to do this. â€œOr you can get into the bath that should be ready by now.â€
I pulled away; lifting a brow. â€œAre you suggesting that I smell?â€
Rhys smirked; and I could have sworn my core pounded in answer. â€œNever. But â€¦â€ His eyes darkened; the desire and amusement fading as he took in my clothes. â€œThere is blood on you. Yours; and othersâ€™. I thought Iâ€™d be a good mate and offer you a bath before I ravish you wholly.â€
I huffed a laugh and brushed back his hair; savoring the silken; sable strands between my fingers. â€œSo considerate. Though I canâ€™t believe you kicked everyone out of the house so you could take me to bed.â€
â€œOne of the many benefits to being High Lord.â€
â€œWhat a terrible abuse of power.â€
That half smile danced on his mouth. â€œWell?â€
â€œAs much as Iâ€™d like to see you attempt to lick off a weekâ€™s worth of dirt; sweat; and bloodâ€¦â€ His eyes gleamed with the challenge; and I laughed again. â€œNormal bath; please.â€
You see what I mean? Maas tries so hard to write steamy; sexy moments that she stopped noticing that the way she writes them became (a long time ago I dare say) utterly ridiculous. What sane person in their right mind would ever say ""Iâ€™d like to see you attempt to lick off a weekâ€™s worth of dirt; sweat; and blood off me?""
Many; many; many; if not all; of the problems this book has are linked to the writing; silly; childish; bloated; cheesy. It sours everything.
â€¢Not totally disconnected from this; there is also the insistence with which Feyre's bliss with her Court of Friends and Family is continually trotted out; especially if there's the opportunity to describe it through someone else's point of view; as it happens with Lucien's in the first part of the book. There is a reason if one of the axioms of storytelling is that talking about happiness is difficult: it's uninteresting; poor of nuances; syrupy: people don't want to hear about happiness. â€œHappy families are all alike;â€ after all.
â€¢One of the main points of Feyre's character arc should be her discovery of independence and of her inner strength; of the fact that she doesn't necessarily need anyone; especially a man; to guide and direct her every step. A shame the impression we get from the whole series is the very opposite: Feyre's character growth (not automatically meant as an upward trajectory) seems to be irreversibly connected to the ""male"" who is (even virtually) at her side. In this book; she and Rhysand are pretty much a single entity. Can I feel a tinge of outrage at this; please? We women are very able to be complete on our own; thank you very much. The whole ""mating system"" (I can't even; it's too ridiculous) has me not exactly convinced in this regard too. Various characters throughout the book keep having this attitude; especially towards Feyre; that implies a vision of women as mere objects of sexual interest; pawns in a purely male game of lust and authority; and they are never challenged because their brain is full of crap; but simply because they insult Feyreâ€“and not even Feyre as herself; but Feyre as Rhysand's mate; like during the meeting of the High Lords in chapter 46; when someone calls Feyre ""human filth"" and Rhysand's reply is physical violence plus a laconic
â€œDonâ€™t ever;â€ Rhys said; hands sliding into his pockets; â€œspeak to my mate like that again.â€
Again; everything; even on the level of language; revolves around a man and the girl's relationship to said man. I fail to see the women's empowerment in this.
â€¢I've never seen such a cheesy ending. It felt like I had just swallowed a monumental bucket of melted sugar and I couldn't even breathe because the very air got stuck to the sticky back of my throat. Basically it made me finally understand that Maas's main interest was to make sure none of her precious babies got so much as a scratch.
âž½ I was trying to find a way to be tactful and diplomatic about this; but there is none. The first book was nice and very entertaining; the second was still entertaining but way less nice; the third is ignoble. Bottom line: this series is crap. Don't read it. There are far more worthy books out there waiting for you. (less)",11,NEXTBOOK

On this adventure - and all the rest?""
""Always.""
I have died
I finished. 13 hours. I'm in hell.
You think you know pain? YOU DONT. This. This is pain. I have honestly not stopped sobbing for hours. I am broken. I woke up this morning (the day after finishing) and reread the last few chapters and I cried all over again.
I am broken and healing but every piece of my heart belongs to these books. (if you don't get that reference please get out of my life)
Let's discuss some early thoughts:
Was it as good as acomaf? Yes. They're equal at the moment but I have to reread this a few times to put it in perspective.
Was it more painful than acomaf? Hell yes. acomaf was just the beginning of hell.
Do you hate Tamlin? NOT AS MUCH AS I DID. I'll never forgive him for what he did BUT I don't want to kill him every second of every day now. I mean he did bring her to Rhys so thank you Tamlin ‚
Is Rhysand still the love of your life? Hell yes.
IS LUCIEN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING?! YES FUCKING YES OMFG! Lucien was a star in this book and I adored his story.
I loved Mor so much in this book guys. My heart BROKE for her over and over again like wowwww.
Azriel is a precious little cinnamon roll and he deserves a big freaking hug. I love the guy.
CASSIAN IS A HOT MESS AS ALWAYS AND I LOVE IT. His scenes with Nesta though damnnnnnnnn I have been slayed!
ELAIN IS A HIDDEN BAD ASS OH MY GOD I AM SHOOK AT HER CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
AMRENNNNNN IS WILD! Oh my god my heart broke over and over with her too and holy shit I NEED MORE FROM AMREN!
As always; Feyre is my queen. Like wow her character is just A+ perfect and I loved seeing her in such a better state than she was before. She is so damn smart and wicked and her scheming is incredible.
Rhysand; of course; is the love of my life. My standards for men are now so damn high. If you're not Rhys; get out of my face. He is absolute perfection as always. My all time favourite character. I adore him so so much and I really want to see more of him. This can't be our final goodbye; Rhys.
THE SCENE WITH ALL THE HIGH LORDS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE!
Overall this book was so action packed and mental. I'm still trying to process everything that happened - a whole 24 hours later. I adore this book. It was absolute perfection in my eyes and I couldn't have wanted anything more.
I cannot wait to read more of this world and I'm praying that these characters pop up somewhere because there's definitely a lot of loose ends that I want discussed further. I'm very very very happy with this book and it exceeded my expectations.
If you think there's a full review coming you're probably kidding yourself!
pre review mess:
BUDDY READ WITH BASICALLY EVERYONE ON GOODREADS (mainly Amber though) WOOOOHOOOOOO TODAY IS ACOWAR DAYYYYYYY I WOKE UP AT 3:50AM FOR THIS SHIT
I'm 20000% not sorry for all of the updates I've made BUT THIS BOOK COMES OUT IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS (Australian time) AND IM SCREAMING OMFG
I finished reading the excerpt. FUCK ITS INCREDIBLE ALREADY I CANT WAIT TO READ THE REST ON TUESDAY
SO THE FIRST 7? 8? CHAPTERS CAN BE READ ONLINE AND YOU BETTTTT IM READING THEM RIGHT NOW CYA
https://odcom-ab554137c550d28e112a628...
So; you can read the first excerpt of this book and MAN I AM DEAD. Basically; Sarah confirmed that we will be switching characters in the next three books and I think a little part of me broke inside. Leaving these characters behind makes me want to curl up in a ball and cry like a baby. ACOMAF is my favourite book of all time and the fact that we have to leave my favourite characters behind in a little under a week honestly hurts. I'm being way too sentimental and way too attached to fictional characters but I'm just a little bit broken. Anyways; you can read the first chapter here:
http://ew.com/books/2017/04/26/sarah-...
There are now spoilers roaming around the internet for this book. BE SAFE! Also; if someone accidentally spoils me I will kill them. Don't be that asshole who spoils someone or reacts to spoilers. If you hunt for spoilers; KEEP THEM TO YOURSELF UNLESS SOMEONE PRIVATELY ASKS FOR THEM. 9 days left by the way!!!!
I'm going to have 3 copies of this book (+ 1 ebook too)and if you think I regret anything then you are WRONG
Edit:ACOWAR COMES OUT IN EXACTLY 1 MONTH TODAY!!!!!
Edit: WE HAVE A COVER.
Okay; I woke up at 5am for this cover because I missed it at midnight (Australia time) when it came out. ITS SO DAMN BEAUTIFUL AND I WONT LET ANYONE TELL ME OTHERWISE. This is still my most anticipated 2017 release and omfg I don't think I can continue to function without this book. GIMME GIMME
Edit: WE HAVE A TITLE *screams* is there a way to make this book come quicker?!

My heart is in pain and full of love for this series.
I don't know what else to say; other than I had the BEST time reading this with my partner in crime; Lena!
We're obsessed with this series and it doesn't get better than fangirling with someone about a book/author you both equally love as much. â¤ï¸
And now I'm in this mess where my heart feels hollow; drained and I cannot stop replaying the scenes of this book in my mind.
I'm so happy; so goddamn happy that we're getting more of this world and these characters.
Now; I need to mourn this book by reading another book.

Anyone else still thinking about this book?! I sniff a reread coming up!
Post-Mourning review:
And it's the day after I finished this beautiful; exhilarating book. I don't think I'm going to bother writing a review; simply because I wouldn't do it justice. Neither would it showcase how much it means to me. Other than to say that I feel this sense of loss and wonder that I felt when I finished reading Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. This series has become that ingrained in me; my soul. And I couldn't be more appreciative and grateful for these books. So; thank you; Sarah J Maas; our High Lady. †
Thank you for creating such incredible characters that mean the absolute world to me and world I never wanted to leave. This is the exact reason why I read.
ORIGINAL REVIEW:
And I thought it couldn't get better than ACOMAF...
Sarah J Maas; my goddess of everything; you have obliterated me. Shattered my soul and healed it. Words will not do justice in me expressing how much I adore you; your books; and the extend of what this book means to me. The expectations I had and others had set for this book were met above and beyond and I think this book is your soul laid bare...
I cannot recall crying this much over a book; ever. Ever! And now heart feels heavy and sick with love whilst simultaneously grieving over these characters; a set of characters that are now ingrained in my soul; their world and the end of this phenomenal story you have created.
I cannot thank you enough for writing this story!

I want to print off a picture of this cover and keep it in my wallet. Just in case anyone asks me if I have children; I can just show them this.
Because all these assholes are my children.
I donâ€™t even know where to start with this review. Iâ€™ve been writing things and then deleting them for weeks. Every combination of words just isnâ€™t the right combination I need to right the perfect review. Sarah J. Maas always releases not one; but two gigantic books a year and I donâ€™t even know how to write a thousand word review? Actual proof that SJM is a writing goddess. We have been blessed from the heavens.
So anyways; I've decided to write whatever the hell comes to my head. So this entire review is one huge train wreck. It's an unorganized mess. I'm gonna apologize for that right now. It also contains unmarked spoilers because it is almost three thousand words long and I don't have time to go through and mark every single spoiler.
ACOWAR had the unfortunate luck of having to proceed the epicness that was A Court of Mist and Fury. Itâ€™s like being given $1;000;000; spending it all; then being given only a $100;000. Both amounts of money are nice to have; but obviously the million is the better option. Or like watching Beyonce perform live in concert; then having to watch a youtube video of Beyonce. Both are nice; great options; but there is always going to be the preferable one. I actually feel sorry for ACOWAR. It didnâ€™t deserve to be a follow-up to A Court of Mist and Fury; but it really didnâ€™t have an option. ACOWAR is better than ;A Court of Thorns and Roses but if you were to look up the definition of â€œprefectionâ€ in the dictionary; there will be a picture of the ACOMAF cover.
Let me just get some of my thoughts & feels written down real quick. Beware; some might be spoilery. Please proceed with caution.
A COURT OF THOUGHTS & FEELS
1. Rhys is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him
2. Feyre is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her
3. Mor is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her
4. Lucien is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him
5. Amren is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her
6. Azriel is actually the best fictional character even and I love him
7. Cassian is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him
8. Tamlin is actually the worst fictional character ever and I hate him
9. I hate him so much
10. Seriously
11. Who okayâ€™d Tamlin as a character?
12. They should be fired
13. Ianthe sucks too
14. (view spoiler)
15. We could have done without the sex scenes though.
16. Remember when they were in the library? And all they wanted to do was have sex and not read. Talk about unrealistic.
17. Rhys is the most dramatic character in YAâ€¦...pass it on
18. The beginning; when Feyre was at the Spring Court; was actually my favorite part of the entire book? I loved it.
19. I was just like yaaas Feyre girl you destroy those losers
20. Also when Feyre and Rhys were reunited that was cool
21. I wanted that scene to be longer though with a lot less sex
22. (view spoiler)
23. Also who approved the term â€œvulgar gesture???â€ They should be fired too.
24. Also if I ever hear the word ""mate"" again I'm gonna spontaneous combust
25. Cassian + Feyre = A friendship you will never have
26. Mor is gay and all is okay
27. (view spoiler)
28. Also Amren is the best thing to come out of this book
29. If the sequels arenâ€™t about her Iâ€™m sueing.
30. Also does anyone know why we were fighting this war? I don't remember.
31. And also does anyone remember how the high lord powers work and why they all happen to be the most powerful people their courts but they get their position through genetics? Because if I haven't learned anything from YA literature; at least I've learned that there will always be a chosen one who's more powerful than any ruler. So why hasn't that happened?
CHARACTERS! cHARACTERS
Feyre. Feyre is the best? She has evolved so much since the first book. And she's so loyal to those she loves. But if she hates you; you are dead. There is no way to save you.
Rhys. I don't know if you knew this; but in certain countries it's agaisnt the law to hate Rhys. He's the best.
Tamlin. Remember that time when you used to like Tamlin? Hahahaha he's an asshole.
Mor. (view spoiler) But she's the best.
Amren. I want to be her when I grow up. She's the best.
Lucien. I am just so glad that Lucien found God in this book.
Cassian. I just love Cassian? I just want him to wrap me up in his wings. He's the best.
Azriel. I would leave my boyfriend Kaz for Azriel. He's the best.
SUMMARY AND COMMENTARY
Iâ€™m going to do something I never done before in a review. There are so many scenes that I just want to talk about; that Iâ€™m gonna summarize a lot of this book so I can talk about them. This entire thing is spoilery so please don't read unless you've read the book.
So we start off at hell the Spring Court and Tamlin is being is douchebag self like always. Heâ€™s just hanging around; doing his meninist things. Not realizing that Miss High Lady of the Night Court over there is slowly taking down his court.
A nightmare; Iâ€™d told Tamlin.
I was the nightmare.
I was kinda hoping for more telepathic interactions? I wanted Feyre to say something like; â€œOh Rhys was just terrible to me.â€ and Rhys to just pop up and be like; â€œTerribly good in bed.â€ or something like that. But that never happened. SJM really threw away her shot. Hamilton would be disappointed.
Iâ€™m going to be honest here. I didnâ€™t really understand how Feyre took down the Spring Court? Like I know she did it by gaining the peopleâ€™s trust. But I didnâ€™t understand that sunlight scene or all the uneventful trips to the wall. Also Ianthe didnâ€™t die in the first part which was disappointing. BUT IANTHE DOES GET HER HAND SMASHED INTO LITTLE PIECES BY FEYRE WHICH IS SO FREAKING BRUTAL I screamed the entire time like wow I donâ€™t like the bitch either but did she really deserve to have her hand continuously smashed? I am a good person who has morals and part of me is still like â€œyeah she deserved thatâ€
Anyways Feyre is eventually like #byelosers @ the Spring Court and leaves. She takes Lucien with her which is really cool because Lucien deserved better than those assholes. So Lucien and Feyre flee the Spring Court; which at this point is burning.
In fact I have an actual; never before seen picture of the spring court taken shortly after Feyre left
Some stuff happens and there's fighting because itâ€™s a high fantasy novel and not having any fighting would probably make it a contemporary or something. But anyhow; Cassian eventually comes and helps Feyre and Lucien with the fighting. And the Cassian/Feyre reunion is the best reunion in this book? Like what Feyre/Rhys reunion?
I met those laughing; fierce hazel eyes.
Cassianâ€™s smile softened. â€œHello; Feyre.""
My throat tightened to the point of pain; and I threw my arms around his neck; embracing him tightly.
â€œI missed you; too;â€ Cassian murmured; squeezing me.
Honestly; that scene was the absolute best? Like after that; the Feysand reunion was so underwhelming. It happened just a few pages later but it wasnâ€™t cute dialogue and hugs and ***friendship*** Their meetup was crying on the floor then having unnecessary explicit sex.
SJM is great and all; but her sex scenes are the worst. I understand that sex is a thing that exist and Feysand participates in it; but I just donâ€™t care about the details. I would rather have more Amren dialogue.
So at one point during all this reunion sex; Feyre tells Rhys that he likes a dramatic entrance which has just won an oscar for â€œunderstatement of the yearâ€. Because obviously; Rhys did not crash Feyreâ€™s wedding in ACOMAF
The next part of the book is just like plotting and stuff. Itâ€™s kind of boring. I honestly almost fell asleep during the next two hundred pages? I mean I didnâ€™t though because this is a SJM book but I could have. There was no action. No suspense. At least I had Amren and her I-donâ€™t-give-a-shit attitude to keep me awake.
There is the library scene which is the worst scene in the entire book. So Feyre and Rhys are in this gigantic ass library surrounded by books which is like life goals right? If you donâ€™t want to be surrounded by books then gtfo of my review. But anyways; instead of appreciating the luxuries they have in their life; Feyre and Rhys spend the entire time flirting with each other? This annoyed me so much. It was the most unrealistic scene in this entire series. I donâ€™t care if my High Lord mate was there with me. If I was in a library surrounded by books; then he doesnâ€™t freaking exist in that moment.
Also there is a giant monster thing that lives in the basement of this library that everyone is afraid of? #goals
â€œIf you hadnâ€™t stolen my bride away in the night; Rhysand; I would not have been forced to take such drastic measures to get her back.â€
I said quietly; â€œThe sun was shining when I left you.â€
So Rhys and Feyre and the rest of the squad decided to throw a party. By party I mean; they decided to get all the incredibly powerful; opinionated fae in one place and try to come to an agreement. This is such a smart idea. Just wow. They also invite Tamlin to be nice and then they act surprised when he shows up??? Like you guys sent him an invite to your birthday party??? It would be rude of him not to come???? Why would he turn down free cake like that?!?!?!
Tarquin took him in. Then me. And the others. â€œI rescind the blood rubies. Let there be no debts between us.â€
â€œDonâ€™t expect Amren to return hers;â€ Cassian muttered. â€œSheâ€™s grown attached to it.â€
So the greatest thing ever happened during this meeting? And Iâ€™m not talking about when Feyre destroyed Tamlin when he was being a prick. No; Iâ€™m talking about how Amren isnâ€™t returning her ruby that marks her for death? Sheâ€™s so iconic. I want to be Amren when I grow up.
Then; while all these high lords were in the same place and wasting time fighting with each other; donald trump the King of Hybitch Hyburn brings down the wall that they were all trying not so desperately to protect. And again; they were all surprised.
Like are you fUCKing kidding me? How did you not see this coming???? You are standing around; doing pratically nothing. Wasting all the time in the world. AND YO UARE SUPRISED THAT HYBITCH IS ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH WITH HIS PLANS. YOU KNOW HE WAS TRYING TO BRING THAT WALL DOWN. he WAS GONNA DO IT AND YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS THE PERFECT OPPURTUNITY. Honestly; I am surprised he didnâ€™t succeed earlier than this?
So noW that the wall has been destroyed and is never coming back; all these high lords realized that if they are going to win this war; they are gonna all get off their asses to do something.
Also what even are we fighting for? All I know about this war is that the King of Hyburn is bad and the Night Court Squad is good. How did this war even start? What did Amarantha have to do with anything? Who even is Myriam person and what does she have to do with anything? I know it was probably explained in ACOMAF but that was a year ago and I was too busy placing my attention on Rhys to pay any attention. So at this point Iâ€™m 469 pages into the last book of this trilogy and I donâ€™t even know what we are fighting for? Iâ€™m emotionally invested in a war I know nothing about. Is this what politics are like?
Anyways; the squad and their newly found high lord allies go to take down Hybitch.
So then Feyre has this brilliant idea to go find out good friend the Suriel. I forgot the Suriel even existed tbh. Heâ€™s so creepy that I am sure my brain purposely block him out from my ACOTAR memories. So we go find Mr. Suriel and he is near the Weaverâ€™s cottage. I also blocked the weaver out from my memories so; if you are like me; this is when you bust open your ACOTAR coloring book; flip to the picture of the Weaver; and then pretend to remember.
So the Suriel is kinda helpful but unhelpful as always. But Feyre still cares about him becasue why wouldâ€™t you care about the creepy monster that doesnâ€™t even have a proper name and you've only met like three times? So Suriel; that unhelpful yoda; is in the middle of giving Feyre vague advice when THAT BITCH IANTHE SHOWS UP AND JUST SHOOTS HIM WITH AN ARROW FOR NO GOOD REASON. Obviously having a crushed hand hasnâ€™t affected her aim any.
Someone should just kill that bitch already. Which is exactly what Feyre does. And she isnâ€™t even easy on her. She takes Ianthe into the Weaverâ€™s cottage and the weaver like eats her. Gross. I would have atleast chosen a less graphic demise. And something that kills her a lot longer.
How fortunate are we that we caught the impossible-to-catch Suriel for the third time right near the cottage of a monster thing that likes to eat bitches? We are soooo fortunate.
â€œFeyre Archeron;â€ the Suriel said again; gazing at the leafy canopy; the sky peeking through it. A painful inhale. â€œA request.â€
I leaned close. â€œAnything.â€
Another rattling breath. â€œLeave this world...a better place than how you found it.â€
So after murdering Ianthe; Feyre goes back to the dying Suriel and I have The Hunger Games flashbacks to Rueâ€™s death scene. I was kind of expecting Feyre to gather flowers to place around the Suriel. And obviously; even though we are in a world surrounded by magic; there is no way to save the Suriel. He dies. Iâ€™m devastated. You are devastated. I still vaguely remember the Suriel from the past two books.
And if Iâ€™m honest; this all could have been avoided if Feyre wasnâ€™t so dramatic and just asked the Suriel to coffee or something.
Oh also; I just happened to have stumbled upon this picture of Feyre that was taken one time after someone was shocked she caught the Suriel
More stuff I donâ€™t care about happens blah blah blah and then Feyreâ€™s sister; Elain; is somehow kidnapped by the cauldron. Also making a cauldron the most powerful object in all the universe is the stupidest thing Iâ€™ve ever read. How did the Cauldron kidnap Elain? I donâ€™t know it is never really explained how that inanimate object does anything. Remember; I still donâ€™t know why the crap we are at war here. Anyways; Feyre gets really upset so she goes undercover as Ianthe and infiltrates the Hyburn army and saves Elain. Feyre goes through maybe one obstacle along the way and then returns to her mate Rhys.
Also; if you are a person who participates in drinking games; then hereâ€™s a fun one for you while you read the book. Every time the word â€œmateâ€ is said you drink. And get drunk during the first chapter. You'll be in the hospital by the third chapter. So actually donâ€™t play that drinking game.
And was I the only person who felt this entire thing was so unneeded? This is a 700 page book and we are nearing the end and now we are going on missions that run a little too smoothly? Like I know Azriel gets hurt but heâ€™ll heal perfectly fine because we live in a world of healing magic that works on bat wings but not bitchâ€™s hands.
More fighting. There is a lot of fighting that happens. Itâ€™s like they are at war or something.
Oh remember Feyreâ€™s father? Yeah; I donâ€™t either. But he comes back. I didnâ€™t know he was gone but he came back with ships named after his daughters and Odette from Swan Lake but instead of a Swan; sheâ€™s a firebird which might just be a stupid name for a phoenix; oh and he name isnâ€™t Odette. Anyways; her father finds this queen they just happened to be looking for even though thereâ€™s no way he could have possibly known that because he has been missing for 37297843 years. So obviously; because of this all his past sins are forgiven instantly. Then her father eventually dies because of Trump Hybitch and we are suppose to be sad about it but Iâ€™m still standing here like
Then; on page 666; because Sarah is in fact the devil; the unthinkable happens. MY BABY RHYS WHO IS SUPPOSE TO BE PROTECTED AT ALL TIMES DIES. YES DIES. AND AT THIS POINT Iâ€™M CRYING IN THE CORNER AND WANTING TO THROW THE BOOOK INTO A VOLCANO
And Iâ€™m just like; â€œIf he ficking stays dead then at least all 700 pages of this book will make great kindling to warm my now cold heartâ€
But then I remember ACOTAR and how Feyre here died and then was brought back to life so I start looking at the other high lords who happen to be near us at this moment and Iâ€™m just â€œHey do a girl a favor here AND BRING BACK MY BOYFRIEND.â€
But then I also remember thereâ€™s a certain asshole who is also a high lord who has to help and I Start FREAKING out but then he comes through and heâ€™s just like â€œBe happy; Feyre;â€ and SAVES RHYâ€™S LIFE
You still an asshole Tam; but maybe just a little bit less.
ANd Iâ€™m just crying in the corner even harder than before.
Then somehow they defeat the King of Hybitch and Feyre and Rhys live happily ever after. Both are alive. The #NightSquad is still alive. Beause that is super realistic.
Looks like the only person who is dead here is me. Oh well.
CONCLUSION
So while ACOMAF is still the best; this is still a great novel and I loved it? Being with all my children again is all I have ever asked for in life and I 'm just glad that they all ended up happy. (less)",18,NEXTBOOK

Before I say anything; I must say this:
What the fuck is this ""vulgar gesture"" that has been mentioned over and over and a-FUCKING-over again throughout all this series; which all the characters seem to gift each other with?
No for real; I would love to know.
Are they all giving each other a different ""vulgar gesture"" every time; or is it ONE single gesture.
And if so; which one?
This one?
This one?
How about this one?
No?
How about the ever tried and true?
Or; perhaps; MY personal favorite:
No?
Well; whatever. I would love to know.
Anynotawave; if you follow my reviews; you know that I didn't particularly love book one and two of this series like most people did. And; conversely; most people who adored books one and two seemed to be less...enthused with this book.
So; of course; leave it to me to be the complete opposite of everyone else.
Because; even though I wasn't OMG in lurve with books one and two; I found myself really into this one.
Maybe it just took books one and two to really dig my heels into the series - who knows - but I was really digging the characters in this one.
Obviously; I loved the relationship between Feyre and Rhys...
The group love and loyalty of the Night Court inner circle...
And the connection between Feyre and her sisters...
But - and I know this is not the case with most people - I am REALLY loving Nesta's story.
I have been oddly drawn to her and her cold bitchiness since book one and I REALLY loved the growth she displayed in this book; the dynamic between her and Cassian; just everything.
And of course; RHYS. Who can not love Rhys?
In fact; this book actually made me really appreciate books one and two more.
I might go back and read them again.
But until then; I am looking forward to the next book in the series.
And I also just obtained the Throne series; so hopefully I will enjoy that one from the onset.

â€œA nightmare; Iâ€™d told Tamlin. I was the nightmare.â€
I had really high hopes for this; like really high; and I did enjoy it; but I can't help being reminded that this was nothing close to the perfection that ACOMAF was. My reading experience was honestly reminiscent to Harry Potter; because I was fangirling every other page; while squealing and giggling and rolling around on my bed like I was twelve again! And when I saw that the prologue was in Rhysand's point of view; I did the longest yeah boy ever. Big shout outs to Paloma and Gelisvb for putting up with my thirsty self throughout our read-throughs! â¤
Yet; when I turned that last page a wave of disappointment and apprehension hit me; and it hit me hard. There was some really bad feeling plot fixes that were really forced; unbelievable; and convenient. Then; which I will never fault an author for trying to put diversity and representation in her cast; but Sarah J. Maas made it feel really inauthentic and exploitative; I'm not going to lie. I also feel like she added so many side characters and side plots to further advance the spin-offs that are going to start coming in 2018. Also; anyone else feeling some Swan Lake retelling vibes?
The one thing that I didn't enjoy; but I'm sure many of my friends and followers will enjoy; is that there was a lot less sex in this book. Like; that first sex scene hit; and I was like ""okay"" and that was really the only major sex scene throughout this 700 page book. Like; they spoke about sex; and gave little tidbits of small sex scenes here and there; and for sure alluded to having sex a lot; but it was nothing close to the erotic things that ACOMAF and EoS had inside them. Nowhere freakin' close.
This is the first conclusion we've ever had from Sarah J. Maas and I am overall very happy with this very loose retelling of Snow White. I don't want you guys to think I hated this or anything; because I obviously didn't and a three star rating is still good! I just expected this to end up on my ""best books of 2017"" list; like both ACOTAR (2015) and ACOMAF (2016) did; and I'm not so sure that it will.
Also; a lot of people were hurt and offended by some acephobia in the ACOWAR preview chapters; surrounding Hybern's niece and nephew that were very much involved with each other (yeah; think Jamie and Cersei). I completely see both sides of this argument and; again; your opinions and feelings are completely valid; but I feel like it's very important to note that there is a discussion going on around this; especially to all my ace friends and followers; because I never want to see any of you harmed or hurt; especially not by problematic material in books.
The rest of my review is going to contain MAJOR SPOILERS for both ACOTAR; ACOMAF; and this book; ACOWAR! Please; do not proceed to read any further unless you have read this book and its predecessors or you wish to be spoiled!
â€œI repeated their names silently; over and over into the darkness. Rhysand. Mor. Cassian. Amren. Azriel. Elain. Nesta.â€
Okay; let's just talk about the characters and how they made me feel for a minute:
âž½ Feyre (The Night Court) - Feyre is such a well developed character. Seeing everything she's gone through; and how much she's grown; it is just incredible. I loved how she dismantled the Spring Court. I loved when she fell to her knees when she saw Rhysand. I loved how she picked her sisters over everything. I loved Feyre in this; and I most loved that by the end of this trilogy she loved herself.
âž½ Rhysand (The Night Court) -My heart; my soul; my body; my everything. If I could have one book boyfriend; I would pick Rhysand every fucking time. No contest; no questioning; nothing; I'd pick Rhysand instantly. Boys; read this book and study this man! I think most girls can agree he is the closest thing to perfection in this world. His banter; his sense of humor; his selflessness; his devotion; his unconditional love; his patience; his determination; everything. When we would be reminded how he taught Feyre to read; I can't even describe that feeling. Sarah J. Maas was so smart to write that; because all of us as book and reading lovers can relate to how empty a world would feel without reading; and Rhysand gave that to her! Ah; I can't. I have no words; other than Rhysand is perfection.
âž½ Cassian (The Night Court) - The light of my life and everything that is good in this world. Cassian made this book so enjoyable for me. He had so many good quotes; too! I couldn't believe how hard he won me over; but I was swooning for him throughout this entire book!
âž½ Azriel (The Night Court) - Azriel; as much as I do like him; is going to cause Lucien so much pain and suffering. I mean; I feel really bad for him because of Mor; and I desperately want him to find someone; but the future is looking pretty bleak for him; I'm not going to lie. Maybe the girl that he and Feyre saved will end up being his mate. I mean; that would seem random for Sarah J. Maas if she didn't end up playing a bigger role; and we know how much she likes pairing people off.
âž½ Morrigan/Mor (The Night Court) - Or maybe that girl will end up with Mor! You know that exploitative feeling I was talking about at the start of my review? Yeah; it's right here. Mor is now a lesbian; which would have made such a powerful impact on me if it didn't feel fake and forced. Again; I'm not going to fault anyone for trying to have more representation in their books; especially not someone like Sarah J. Maas who needs more representation in their books; but this didn't feel authentic to me whatsoever. Also; there was that scene where everyone was pretty much like ""Yeah! I'm bisexual; too!"" and that felt really condescending and borderline offensive to me. I'm very curious to see what everyone else thinks about Mor's development. Also; Rhys' interactions with Mor in this book were not okay. He treated Mor badly in this book. Not only did he end up making her feel unsafe at the meeting with her father; ultimately making her feel unsafe in her own home; but he also made her sit through all that abuse when the High Lords met up. Both scenes were honestly hard to stomach; and completely abusive and not okay.
âž½ Amren (The Night Court) - I felt a little baited by Amren at the end. Not the question if she was bad or not; I never really thought that; but when she came out of the cauldron with Rhys; I thought she was a human! So I was like ""oh my gosh; how is this going to work now that she's weaker than she was; and she's going to age and everything?"" And then Rhys is like ""Well; she's still a high fae and I'm sure she will develop a new power!"" And I'm like.... Okay; I was dumb.
âž½ Varian (The Summer Court) - Varian and Amren's romance was everything! When she came out of the tent wearing his shirt; I lost it. I loved that they found happiness with each other; and I love than Varian begged her but ultimately supported her decision to save everyone. Relationship goals; you all.
âž½ Nesta - I love when an author makes me feel very vast and different things for a character; and I will give Sarah J. Maas all the props in the world for Nesta. I really thought she was being so unfair and hard towards Feyre; especially after everything Feyre has done for her family; but it ended up working out for me. I loved that Nesta was connected to the cauldron; because she refused to not take something from it. I loved how she didn't just swoon and fall all over hot ass Cassian instantly; because I'm not sure I would have that same strength. I loved how she forgave and accepted the love her sister wanted to give her all along. I loved the scene with her; Feyre; and Elain all curled up together; because I love books about siblings being close and having that unconditional love with each other. I'm so happy they found it; and I can't wait to read more about it in future spin-offs. When Nesta laid down on top of Cassian; I had to put my book down and walk around my house for like fifteen minutes; because I couldn't deal. It was perfect and if I could have any spin-off I would pick Cassian and Nesta.
âž½ Elain - Like; when that human boy told her he'd never love her; just because she's fae now; my heart broke. I don't know why that felt so real to me; but that hit me way harder than it should have. I guess it is just the young girl in me; remembering how you think your first love will be your only love; and then getting slapped with the realization that that isn't ever close to being true; but yeah; I felt that scene. I loved that Elain is a seer; and I can't wait to see how that develops further with the spin-offs. Also; give me that good Lucien angst; please.
âž½ Lucien - First and foremost; I loved who really was Lucien's dad. Like; that was a plot twist that I loved and wasn't expecting at all! Now; more Dawn Court please! It also gives me all the hope in the world that Lucien will get a spin-off. Also; I'm really curious to learn more about Lucien's past and about Jesminda.
âž½ Tamlin (The Spring Court) - I am not excusing his or anyone else's abuse; ever; but my favorite part of this book was when Tamlin told Feyre to be happy. Take that information and do what you wish with it; but I wouldn't hate a Tamlin spin-off where he learns how to control the anger and rage inside of him. I never truly ever hated Tamlin; I just fell in love with Rhys the first moment he appeared in ACOTAR.
âž½ Alis (The Spring Court) - Beautiful little cinnamon roll! I was so happy that her and those two little boys were in this final installment! I loved her perception; her input; and her constant encouragement. I hope this isn't the last time we see Alis.
âž½ Ianthe (The Spring Court) - Evil bitch from Hell; legitimately the devil incarnate. I loved her death; like; fucking loved it! And I loved the greater discussion on how women can rape and sexually assault men; too. When someone doesn't want you to touch them; don't touch them. It's not a hard concept; and it is something that not just men are guilty of; and I really liked the showcasing of that.
âž½ Tarquin (The Summer Court) - I like Tarquin a lot; and I think Sarah J. Maas will further progress his character as the spin-off stories go on. Also; I loved how he mass killed Hybern's army by drowning them on land.
âž½ King of Hybern - He was super rapey in this book. Like; he kept threatening rape constantly and I'm like; ""where did this come from?"" Also; for being such a powerful and smart leader who has been waiting for his vengeance all these years; he was pretty dumb. Like; he just let a girl walk up and stab him in the back of the neck. Really? Super anticlimactic and chaotic evil villain.
âž½ Jurian - I loved his plot-twist and how he was playing secret agent with Hybern. Jurian was; for me; an all around good character; and super enjoyable to read about. And; holy moly; does he have some background stories to tell. I have a strong feeling he and Queen Vassa are going to receive the spin-off; and even though it isn't my personal first choice; I will totally still read it.
âž½ Miryam - Miryam was Jurian's half-fae ex lover who is talked about pretty frequently in this series. Everyone presumed her dead; but it is revealed that she faked her death so she could live peacefully with Drakon on a hidden island very similar to Velaris! She's also going to take the cauldron back to hide it with her and Drakon's people.
âž½ Drakon - I love Drakon's back story on how he was given Miryam as a slave for an arranged marriage gift; and how he let her go to just ultimately fall in love and give up everything for her. Yeah; big fan. Also; him and Miryam totally came and helped save the day in the end; so kudos to both of them.
âž½ The Bone Carver - The Bone Carver ended up being one of my favorites from this story. He also opened the door for old gods in this story; and I can't wait to see how that develops! His death hit me pretty hard; just because I believe he was fully aware of what would happen; yet he sacrificed his life anyway because Feyre was worthy. Please; these tears.
âž½ The Weaver - In ACOMAF; I loved the story arc with the Weaver and her house; so I was really excited when it became apparent that she was going to be in this story; too! I cannot believe she is the sister of the Bone Carver; and her actions and emotions during the final battle hit me pretty hard. Again; such a wonderful character that was an absolute treat to read about; especially with Ianthe's ending.
âž½ Bryaxis - Um; I need Bryaxis; Feyre; Nesta; and Elain tea parties right now! I know so little about this mysterious creature; but my heart wept for its seclusion under the library for all those years. I can't wait to see interactions with Bryaxis and the others!
âž½ The Suriel - LITTLE ANGEL THAT WAS TOO GOOD AND PURE FOR THIS WORLD. I thought we would see the Suriel in this final installment; but his death hit me like Dobby from Harry Potter. I was not prepared and neither were my never ending tears. Seriously; the Suriel was the star of this book.
â€œI understood why the Suriel had come to help me; again and again. Not just for kindness â€¦ but because it was a dreamer. And it was the heart of a dreamer that had ceased beating inside that monstrous chest.â€
I guess I'll move on to some of the plot developments that bothered me. Like; I loved when Lucien went off to on his side quest to find the lost queen and her court; but then Feyre's dad came and saved the day in the end; with an entire army at his disposal. Like; that felt bad. Didn't this dude leave his daughters poor and starving? All because he knew a fae war was coming? I don't buy or believe that what so ever and I completely think Sarah J. Maas killed him off because that would have been such a weird and awkward reunion! I honestly hated that the dad showed up. Hated it. I wish Lucien would have gotten all the glory. Like; it's cool he brought an army and named his ships after them; but; dude; you weren't there when your three daughters truly needed you.
Okay; let's talk about the sexual representation that I started to discuss in Mor's character break down above. Let me say this extra loud for people in the back: Just because you have or want to have a threesome with someone of the same sex; even though you are only planning to have sex with the opposite sex; it does not make you bisexual. Okay? Okay. That's such a gross stereotype for bisexuals; regardless. And that scene at the High Lord's conference/meeting made me cringe so freaking hard; it was actually unreal. Also; I'm not telling anyone how to be a bisexual or a lesbian; but my personal opinion is that Mor is more bi. Like; again; I don't want to tell people how to feel about their own sexuality - whatever you feel is completely valid - but she has enjoyed sleeping with men for all these years. Also; her telling Feyre she was a lesbian came straight out of left field. Again; it just felt so forced and so condescending to me. I applaud Sarah J. Maas for trying; I really do; but this representation wasn't well done. Hopefully; in future books; Mor's sexuality is done better and feels more authentic.
Moving on; how did we not get confirmation that Feyre was pregnant? Like; you all were seeing those constant hints too; right? I would have bet everything I owned that that was how this book was going to end; with her telling Rhys; but it never came and I was so shocked!
Also; when Chapter 76 ended with the line â€œRhys was deadâ€ I thought it was real and that's how this book was going to end; with him sacrificing himself for his people. I was ready to throw my book across the room. I thought he was going to die; and that Feyre was going to be pregnant with his baby and that was going to be his legacy. I am so happy it didn't happen like that; but I was crying so hard through Chapter 77 that I could barely see. I'm seriously too damn emotionally invested in the fictional character that is Rhysand.
â€œEvery piece of my still-healing heart belonged to him.â€
Despite all of the things that bothered me; Sarah J. Maas writes romance really well; like really well. All the people that hate on her can say what they want; but she knows how to write that good angst that makes you completely enthralled and addicted; where you can't pull away from her stories. I'm not even close to a Sarah J. Maas fangirl; but I'm speaking the truth; she knows how to write romance; and I think that's why I was disappointed with this book; after being so in love and obsessed with ACOMAF last year. Feyre and Rhys had their romantic build up in ACOMAF; so we didn't get any of that in ACOWAR! This book was the conclusion; which dealt with war; suffering; repercussion of certain actions; and sacrifices. It didn't feel as good as seeing a budding; angst-filled; romance developing between Feyre and the most perfect man ever written; Rhysand.
â€œI would have waited five hundred more years for you. A thousand years. And if this was all the time we were allowed to have â€¦ The wait was worth it.â€
It also explains why I was so hyped for every scene with Cassian and Nesta; and Lucien and Elain; because those are budding romances that are just starting! And I think me being able to see and understand that helps me a lot with realizing that I did enjoy this book; it just wasn't everything that I; personally; wanted. It was still a good conclusion; and I'm so thankful and happy that I was able to read it! Again; a three star rating is good; even though I was expecting this to be a five star rating.
I really enjoyed this; and I completely love this trilogy as a whole! I cannot wait to see what else Sarah J. Maas has in store for Pyrithion and beyond! What did you guys think? Do you think it lived up to ACOMAF? Who do you think the first spin-off will be about? My guess is Jurian and Queen Vassa; but I'm praying for Cassian and Nesta. There are truly so many questions and so many discussions to be had! I can't wait!
I also loved how ACOWAR really brought many book; blogging; and Goodreads communities together; just because of everyone's love and excitement for this series and for reading in general. That is something pure and special; and something that hasn't came around for me since Harry Potter. For that; I will always cherish this series and look forward to more being released in this world.
â€œA gift. All of it.â€

I have always been more of a fan of Sarah J Mass fan; but more towards her Thrown of Glass series. I think this is her best book so far. This book just has everything. Great characters; great story; secrets; betrayal; redemptions; ACTION!!!! You name it is here. 700 pages and not a line wasted. Hell I would have been happy with another 700 pages of this standard. The character are great but there is such great character development no one is one dimensional the character are conflicted; and complex with their own strengths and issues. Every time I learned something about one of the characters I want to know more. Every character had their moment to shine in this book; and every character in this book could very easily star in their own book. That is the depth of the character in this story. Espicallly Rhysand; and anyone in the Court of Dreams.
Since the last book Feyre has returned to the Spring Court to destroy it from with in. This is not Feyre crushed by her truma; suffocated by overprotection; or the powerless girl in a world of monsters/guardians this is the angry; powerful; deadly calculating woman. I like the fact Rhysand is every bit her match. I am actually interested to see which of them is the more powerful. So far with centuries of experience behind of battle; tactics and studies he seem to be a step ahead but time will tell. However even with all this going on War is coming to Prythian and with all the High Lords in agreement (with their history of grudges and betrayal this is next to impossible ); they are still way out numbered against the King of Hybern and the power of the Calderon. Once again is falls to the Court of Dreams to lead the charge not only against their enemies but the very thinking of many Prythians as well.
This is just an awesome book. I don't think you have to read the other book in the series to love this book; but I would definitely recommend reading the whole series; but definitely read this one. The more I read the more I wanted to read; it took me through every emotion; the anger of betrayal; the pride in overcoming adversity; to the election of victory. I honestly do not think SJM could fit anything more into this many pages; lets see if she can do a 1000 pages of this standard. (less)",22,NEXTBOOK

Nothing has changed. This book wasn't any better or worse than the other two in the series. Maybe slightly more exciting. But Sarah J. Maas is Sarah J. Maas and while her stories and her writing often excite me; they also annoy me. A lot.
Since so many (sooo many) people have read this book and written reviews about it; I'll keep mine short. (Well; okay. I now realize this is far from short; but it was worth a try.)
Overdramatic; exaggerated and cheesy are the best words to describe SJM's writing and plotting. It's like every chapter (or paragraph) needs to end with a spectacular cliffhanger; dramatic foreshadowing or a grand gesture. And as with ACOMAF; way too many things happen at the same time and it all starts falling apart while I repeatedly scream ""MELODRAMA"" and ""UNREALISTIC"". Especially because (view spoiler)
The only reason I enjoyed this more than the other two books is because I completely skipped the sex scenes. Whenever Rhy and Feyre started getting horny I just turned the page. And I'm glad I did. The blurbs alone that I read in other people's reviews made me laugh from ridiculousness.
One more thing: where did all the lgbt characters suddenly come from? Did someone get heavily criticised for ignoring this too long and decided to creat - and recreate - gay; lesbian and bisexual characters? While I'm glad to finally see this happening (It only took her 8 books but whatever) I still worry about it. Spoilers ahead: One character explains that she only keeps sleeping with men because she doesn't want to reveal that she likes women. Which is why she keeps having sex with them; so the guy who's in love with her is reminded that he can't have her; while also staying oblivious to the truth that she kept from him for 500 years. Yup; 500 years. And she did not only keep it from him; but from every single one of her close friends. Realistic; I know. (Not to mention that this whole entire coming out scene felt entirely staged and; guess what; overdramatic.)
So there's that. See how torn I am with these books? Why do I keep reading them? It's definitely a guilty pleasure. They're not badly written and the fantasy aspects are very exciting. It's also a huge phenomenon and hype; one that I don't yet know how to escape from.

Actually it's not a 5-star rating; more like 4.5678-star for me. But this book; this blessed book brought me to tears and my heart nearly exploded through it. RHYS. I breathe him in and don't want to let him out. I longed for ACOWAR since it didn't even have the title and promised myself that I couldn't die before I got my hands on it. I can't gather the words to express how I am feeling right now. Everything is just right. EPIC. PERFECT. EXQUISITE. RHYS I loved him with every bit of my heart. And Feyre; her development shocked me. As you know; she's High Lady of the Night Court; and when I was certain that her pesona couldn't get any better from ACOMAF; I was wrong because she slays and slays and slays. I even saw Aelin in Feyre when she leads her people and makes a vital decision at the end. Don't do that to me ever again; Feyre !
Tamlin. I don't hate him at all. I always see him as an ordinary human. He raged. He blamed the others. He made wrong decisions. But eventually; he is what he is. In this book; I can see the reason why Feyre hasn't been his match. Tamlin loves her. Rhysand loves her. A huge difference between these guys is how they treat her; while Tamlin treated Feyre like she's made of glass; Rhys forged her into a weapon she was born to be. And Tamlin has done everything wrong from the moment he lost her. Although he declared that it came from his love; I saw a fine line between love and possession. They're not the same.
â€œI see all of you; Rhys. And there is not one part that I do not love with everything that I am.â€
Cassian; Mor; Azriel; Nesta; Elian; and Amren are the best supporting characters ever. They stand out and have their important roles to play. Cassian is reckless. Mor is easy-going but her heart... Azriel is complicated. Nesta is virile; she has proved herself so much in this book. Elian. Sweet Elian is literally multilayered characters. If Nesta was fire; Elian would be an ember set to burn hotter than fire.
SJM pulled off every piece of the story amazingly. The twists are subtle and profound. High Lords are all intruging and different from one another. I felt the changes through the three parts of this book. The first part and the third are the best; IMO; I loved the first ten chapters the most where Feyre is at the Spring Court. Everything she's done are so appeased.
â€œBecause I canâ€™t stay away.â€
I listened to many songs while I was reading this book; though. One of my favorites is https://youtu.be/tgvbhxb9yk8 It healed my soul whenever something happened and I couldn't prevent myself from crying over for the pain I felt.
Though ACOWAR is not the best of the series (I think the best is ACOMAF as it's so emotional and deep); I still liked the most of it; especially the war and strategies these characters manage to plan out. (view spoiler)
Moreover; ACOWAR is the longest book of the series but SJM somehow wrote and wove every part of the details into the whole perfect picture immaculately. She's a queen of expanding her books and universe yet she can control her stories not to spin out of control.
â€œLeave this world â€¦ a better place than how you found it.â€
I loved this series because of the world-building and romance of the characters. The concept of the Wall dividing two worlds is interesting and the ending is real and what it's supposed to be from the beginning. I'm so glad to know and read this series. It never fails me; never one.
FEYRE FOR LIFE. TAMLIN FOR NOW. RHYS FOR FOREVER.
â€œYou belong to all of us; and we belong to you.â€
My favorites : 1) ACOMAF 2) ACOWAR 3) ACOTAR
Note : Why didn't I give ACOWAR 5 stars ? Why 4.5678 ? Ummmmm; I know the big part of me enjoyed this book wholeheartedly regarding this is the end to this arc (there're more books to come; though) and the most anticipated of this year. But the small part of me felt some things in ACOWAR were too coincidental and easy. Yet SJM ended this thoroughly; and I can't wait to see her finish the ToG series in 2018.

GOOD FUCKING BYE WORLD I AM SO LOST BECAUSE OF THIS BOOK!
Yes; that is dramatic but I don't even care because this book gave me everything I wanted and more. This is a guilty pleasure for me but not so guilty since I will always admit my love for this book/series.
THE CHARACTERS MY GOD.
THE ROMANCE HELL YES.
THE PLOT HAD ME HOOKED.
I'm just overall very happy with my reading experience even though I yet again got no sleep from reading this beast of a book (I know some people judge me for doing that and not fully ""enjoying"" the book by taking my time but hell no; once I start I don't stop).
I don't know what else to say that won't be spoilers so I'm just gonna die happy knowing that I got to FINALLY read this beauty.

If you're reading this; please be warned that you're in for one hell of a rant. There will be quite a lot of swearing and some minor spoilers. (Major spoilers will be marked.) Also; if you liked this book and have a problem with me trashing everything you've ever loved; you may want to turn back now.
â€¦
Iâ€™m giving you one more chance. This is actually the worst book rant Iâ€™ve ever written.
â€¦
No? You really want to read this review?
Move right the fuck along; then. Donâ€™t say I didnâ€™t warn you.
You know when you're at the beach on a really nice summer day; and the sand is all nice and soft and the sun is warm but not too hot and you walk down to the edge of the water for what you just know is going to be a gloriously refreshing swim in the ocean.......so you start wading in; and it seems fine at first; and then all of a sudden your foot comes down in the middle of a massive swath of slimy; smelly; warm seaweed aND YOU TRY TO STEP BACK OUT BUT SUDDENLY ITâ€™S EVERYWHERE AND ITâ€™S AWFUL AND YOUR DAY GOES TO SHIT. THAT is what reading this book felt like.
Buuuut before I get started with the rant; letâ€™s just get this out of the way and discuss the only thing I actually liked: Lucien.
I remember thinking Lucien was just okay in ACOTAR and ACOMAF. Everyone seems to love him; but I was always kind of indifferent towards him. Surprisingly; he was the only character who had actual development in this book; and I ended up liking him way more than I expected to. Getting to see the Autumn Court and learning more about his family and history made him finally feel like a fully fleshed out character; rather than just Tamlin's mediocre sidekick. I still donâ€™t really give a shit about him and Elain; but his friendship with Feyre was lovely. I feel like male/female friendships that are truly platonic are so hard to come by in YA books; and it was so great to see the two of them overcome the anger and guilt that had grown between them in previous books. Unfortunately; Lucien ends up going off on some random-ass irrelevant mission for half the book; leaving me stuck with one of the dullest groups of characters Iâ€™ve read about in a while. *sigh*
Now that thatâ€™s over; the rest of this review is basically gonna be a list of all the stuff I hated; which wasâ€¦.everything else; tbh. This is super unorganized and in no particular order.
The Spring Court. Alright; the Spring Court was boring and annoying in books 1 and 2; so I wasnâ€™t really looking forward to being back there. I thought things would have least been a little more interesting with Feyre 2.0 back to fuck shit up; but all I got was some half-assed Cersei wannabe who was so hell-bent on her personal revenge plot that she gave zero fucks about the consequences and hypocrisy of her actions.
The one-dimensional villain. This was one of my biggest issues with this book. There is absolutely NO moral gray area; every aspect of the war is as black and white as a fucking dalmatian. Why exactly does Hybern want to invade Prythian and take down the wall separating the human realm???????? Literally all we are told; over and over again; is that Hybern is ruthless and vicious and evil and BLAH BLAH BLAH I DONâ€™T CARE. I can accept Amarantha being a sadistic psychopath with little complexity; but even she had her reasons for what she did. In this book ALL of the people from Hybern are universally evil demonic asshats; and as I refuse to believe that an entire nation is composed only of murderous psychopaths. I call bullshit. Thereâ€™s a bunch of infodump about how the king has somehow brainwashed his whole population into supporting the war.....but I donâ€™t fucking buy it. If the people of Hybern were the least impacted by the treaty that split the other territories (as we are explicitly told); why would they be the most opposed to it? I personally LOVE politics; and the political aspect of worldbuilding is always one of my favorite parts of reading high fantasy. ummmm news flash: countries donâ€™t decide to go to war with each other just for the heck of it !!!!! People and nations are complex; and politics and alliances and wars are hella complicated. Reading about the melodramatic nonsensical shit that passed for politics in this book felt like I was being talked down to; and it pissed me off majorly.
The fucking Wall. There's also a shit ton of infodump about the history of the wall; and I felt like I kept falling into a boring and oversimplified history lecture. It was all giving me some serious ASOIAF vibes; too. You could basically just replace the Cauldron with the horn of Joramun and the faeries with the wildlings and some of the plot points genuinely sound as if they were ripped straight from the plot of A Storm of Swords (except way lamer and not nearly as well-developed. Iâ€™m honestly annoyed at myself for even discussing these books in the same sentence).
Jurian. Why is Jurian even in this book????? Like; I get that he was important in the last war; but he and his and his whole plotline seem so irrelevant to everything else that's going on. He's just so fucking extra and unnecessary; his existence annoys me. I wonâ€™t even waste any more time writing about him.
The writing. Itâ€™s so. Fucking. Repetitive. The exact same descriptions are used over and over again for every character; every conversation; every situation. If I never have to read about mates and males and velvet everything and purring and vulgar gestures I will die a happy woman. And; on the subject of said repetitive writingâ€¦â€¦..
The sex scenes. It felt like the first half of the book was 90% Feysand either having sex; sending each other mental nudes; or talking in their heads about how they wanted to â€œfeast onâ€ and â€œdevourâ€ each otherâ€¦â€¦the writing was BEYOND cringe-yâ€¦â€¦and then they had the nerve to be surprised when they were too late to stop Hybern from breaking down the wall ??????? They were also all written the same way; once youâ€™d read one; there was nothing new or interesting about them.
The library. Iâ€™m really fucking pissed about this. The library is a place that we learn has been transformed into a sanctuary for women who have been sexually abused and assaulted. Theyâ€™re able to have a place of peace and quiet where they can stay as long as they want while they heal. I donâ€™t know why I thought this book might actually provide a fair representation of recovery from traumaâ€¦..but any good the inclusion of this library and these women might have done was utterly ruined by the way it was disrespected and used as a plot device. First; the library seemed to be introduced for the sole purpose of making Rhys look betterâ€”the focus was on what a saintly person he was for helping these women rather than actually giving them any page time themselves. Then; when Rhys and Feyre are supposed to be doing actual research in the library; theyâ€™re so fucking horny they apparently think itâ€™s completely fine to almost have sex in a library thatâ€”once again â€”is RUN by women who have been sexually abused. How the actual fuck is that supposed to be okay???????? If that wasnâ€™t enough; the librarians are then treated as even more of a plot device when an attack from Hybern occurs there to make it seem even more outrageous and violating. In response; Feyre and Rhys are all like â€œoh that sucks that they wonâ€™t feel safe here anymoreâ€â€¦â€¦.and what do they fucking do about it???? NOTHING. They donâ€™t actually give a shit about these women so they move on with life and never give them a second thought. UGH.
Feyre being a hypocrite. I love how Feyre got all indignant in the last book about High Fae treating other faeries like shit and yet she still calls them ""lesser faeriesâ€â€¦..also; while she was in the Spring Court I get she was mad but she just never seemed to give a shit about the harm her actions could cause ordinary people???? Just because sheâ€™s physically stronger and more powerful doesnâ€™t mean she has to lose the ability to empathize with and care about other people.
The sexism. Okay; itâ€™s like this book couldnâ€™t decide whether it wanted to be set in a world with a patriarchy or not. Why has there never been a High Lady???? Only allowing High Lords seems really blatantly sexist; but there doesn't seem to be much overt sexism in Prythian. I mean; itâ€™s definitely there; but it doesnâ€™t seem quite strong enough for all women to be entirely denied the right to govern. It just doesn't make sense why none of the female High Fae have never even tried to challenge this law/tradition/precedent ?????? there are so many infuriating plot holes in the worldbuilding UGGHHHHH.
The slut-shaming. It was OUT OF CONTROL in this book. I can't even give a rough estimate for the number of times Feyre; Mor; and Rhys were insulted; degraded; and verbally abused because of who they'd had sex with...and seeing how Mor and Rhys were assaulted and abused; it was especially awful. I mean; the people saying these things were clearly the ones we reader are meant to view as â€œevilâ€; but the sheer number of these insults seemed ridiculously unnecessary. It was annoying and tedious to have to read through so many of them; and they felt like a cheap plot device to further emphasize the black-and-white divide between the â€œgoodâ€ and â€œbadâ€ characters. Speaking of whichâ€¦.
The characters. I donâ€™t even know how to fully express my disappointment with how this book treated my favs. Itâ€™s like all of the characters I loved in ACOMAF turned out to be a lineup of those inflatable Christmas decorations; and someone went around and poked holes in them and now they're just sad and flat and boring. It breaks my heart because I had so much love for Feyre and Rhys and all the rest of the Inner Circle in ACOMAF and somehow I didnâ€™t give the slightest shit about any of them in this book????? I donâ€™t even want to go into it; Iâ€™m so bitter.
I still love Nesta; but even she was a bit disappointing. She was my favorite character because of her subtle but fierce characterization in the last two books; and she had more development than most of the others in this; but she still spent most of her time sitting around doing nothing.
The immaturity of said characters. The comments they make; the way they stick their tongues out at people.....if I didn't know I was reading a book about centuries-old faeries and there weren't a shit ton of unnecessary sex scenes; I'd think I was reading a middle grade novel.
Magic thatâ€™s poorly explained/doesnâ€™t make sense.
What even is a shadowsinger???? I still donâ€™t know??????? What exactly Azriel is was never defined and I have no idea why it's significant/what his powers are; this pisses me off.
What happened to the tracking thing Hybern had on Rhys's power in ACOMAF??? It was mentioned towards the end but didn't seem to be nearly as important in this book; whereas in the last one it was a major cause of him barely using his powers.
Also: so are we all just okay with the fact that after Feyre was transformed into a Mary Sue High Fae she basically got every fucking power that ever existed?? And she doesn't need to actually train to master said powers; she can just use them whenever the fuck she wants?? Ugghhhh it feels so incredibly unnecessary and over the top.
***THE REST OF THIS REVIEW WILL BE SPOILER-Y; READ AT YOUR OWN RISK***

.
The ships. I completely lost interest in Feysand; Nessian was mildly interesting but mostly pushed to the side; I donâ€™t give a shit about the Azriel/Elain/Lucien love triangle that appears to be forming; and Amren and Varian???? That was really fucking random???? I just want to scream â€œNOT EVERYONE NEEDS A SHIPâ€ from the top of a mountain because Iâ€™m honestly so annoyed about this.
The attempts at LGBTQ representation. Mor's sexuality???????????? Where the fuck did that come from?????? I'm just genuinely confused bc in ACOMAF it seemed to be quite obvious that she did have feelings for Azriel. None of this makes sense. She started off saying she preferred women and that was why she could never love Azrielâ€¦â€¦but then she was like â€œoh well I actually enjoy sleeping with both gendersâ€ ??? ummm what kinda logic is that supposed to be?? Either way; it was a shitty thing to do to lead her friend on for centuries and now Iâ€™m pissed at her. She didnâ€™t even have to come out; she just had to straight up tell him she wasnâ€™t in love with him. I can understand her not wanting to come out to her family; but it just doesn't make sense why she would hide it from the whole inner circleâ€”the people she loves and trusts more than anyone else. The more I think about this reveal the less it makes sense. There were no hints; it serves no purpose in the plot; and it feels like a cheap attempt to make the series count as diverse.
The minor characters also felt like such a half-assed attempt at diversity. It was felt so strange bc there was literally no mention of anyone who wasn't totally heterosexual in the first two books; and it felt like ACOWAR was trying way too hard to be like ""look !!! gay people!!!!! threesomes!!!!â€ It's like....it's nice that the author tried; but poor representationâ€”and having all the LGBTQ characters be either inconsequentially minor or badly-developedâ€”doesn't make your book really qualify as embracing diversity.
Tamlin. He was still awful???? I don't care if he was supposedly working against Hybern in secret the whole time; if that was true he should have fucking told Feyre like he promised he would. He's not just a shitty person; he's a shitty character. He's lost all semblance of personality and essentially exists only to highlight what a great guy Rhys supposedly is. I gather that his storyline was supposed to be some kind of redemption arc; but like ????? You canâ€™t just have a character suddenly act nice at the end of the book when there was no actual development shown to precede that!!!!!
The ending. This was some next level deus ex machina shit. I hated it. Of course these randos and minor characters showed up to win the battle for them. Why did I expect that Feyre and Rhys and all the rest of those useless idiots would actually manage to save themselves?
The scene with the ouroboros was BEYOND anticlimactic. This was supposed to be something that had turned people made for centuries and perfect Feyre had no problem looking into it??? I call bullshit. Vassa; Bryaxis; the Bone Carver; Stryga; Miryam and Dragon or whatever the fuck his name isâ€¦.all of these characters/creatures had potential to be interesting; but they were so inconsequential and received so little attention that the book would have been better off without them.
And then what happened with Amren....I actually really liked her in that moment; and I feel like for the first time in this series we finally caught a glimpse of her real character. I just wish there had been more of that throughout the book: less of everyone talking about how terrifying Amren is and more about her actually being badass.
Rhysâ€™s deathâ€¦â€¦I was just so completely beyond the point of caring by then; and it all felt awfully cliche and been-there; done-that.
Itâ€™s like this book actually drained all of the emotions out of me; I hated it that much.
Well; I think thatâ€™s enough trashing for today. You can find my wonderful BR partner Camilleâ€™s review here; and also please read Emâ€™s review because itâ€™s fucking fantastic.
I mostly likely will not be picking up another SJM book in the future; I just donâ€™t think her writing is for me and ACOMAF must have been some kind of random fluke. Also; I donâ€™t think my friendship with Solomon would survive another review this harsh.
Anyway; thanks for reading! I hope you all enjoy the next books you read more than I enjoyed this.

Something thumped in front of me. A bottle of wine. â€œItâ€™s fine if you drink directly from it;â€ was all Mor said.
This book ensared me - body and soul - and the last hundred pages? Whew. Talk about stress - like actual heart-pounding stress.
For those who don't know me; I stress-bake. I was 18 cupcakes and double-batch of cookies deep by the time I reached that end. Man-oh-man. My apartment is now a bakery.
â€œShe is High Lady of the Night Court. She may do as she wishes.â€
Feyre; now ruling the Night Court with Rhysand; is about to go to war.
King Hybern's army is set to march into the human world - ready to slaughter and enslave.
The only chance to save her people is to unite the seven courts and mount a resistance. Only; the odds could not be more against them.
Mile after mile. A kingdom of the rotting dead. And still I looked.
Every direction they turn; the King is two steps ahead - already butchering and torturing anyone who stands in his way. His army - limitless; his powers - fueled by the very Cauldron itself.
The more Feyre and the Night Court resists; the more likely it seems like they'll lose. Not only the war; but everyone they hold dear.
I repeated their names silently; over and over into the darkness. Rhysand. Mor. Cassian. Amren. Azriel. Elain. Nesta.
And yet; despite all the pain and the sorrow flowing around them; one thing remains steadfast. One thing remains absolutely certain.
I would have waited five hundred more years for you. A thousand years. And if this was all the time we were allowed to have â€¦ The wait was worth it.
Whew. This book was the most stunning of the series so far.
Sarah J. Maas juggles so many unique personalities - from the sweetest human to skin-crawling monsters - without them blending into caricatures (Every time; she astounds me with her creations).
Her world has such depth that I'm constantly amazed by the little; reoccurring details (I feel like I could walk the city of Velaris without being lost for a moment).
Her characters feel real - their personas; their movement; their banter - I felt like they were right in front of me; rather than words on a page (how is it possible to fall in love with so many characters in one book?).
I could not be more impressed right now.

And kinda disappoints you ??? I donâ€™t know; so if youâ€™re here for a review you better leave while you can. :)))
So; if you hadnâ€™t noticed; my rating dropped dramatically since I read it and thatâ€™s not bc I am an impressionable child without an opinion but its bc I rated it at 1am while I was sleep deprived and my mind wasnâ€™t functioning 100%
And now after taking some time to think about the book and my true feelings for it and the fact that everything (view spoiler) crashed and burned and there was more tasteless smut in this book than action; we will watch the rating drop together :)))
Also; this review sucks; if you wanna read something that 10/10 and articulate and genius read these reviews by my bbies: emmalineâ€™s review & silâ€™s review
Now; SJM is still one of my all-time favourite fantasy authors and I truly do love her work but lately sheâ€™s just been hurting me. This reviews mainly gonna cover the parts I didnâ€™t like bc its fun to rant about negatives than positives okay sue me.
- Rant #1: Mate
- It SHOULDNâ€™T replace the personâ€™s given name
- plz stop using it in that context
- â€œmy mate is none of your concernâ€
- â€œI studied my mateâ€™s faceâ€
- Listen
- calling the person by their NAME works much better
- it made me cringe so bad I think my jaw might be locked
-
- Rant #2: Diversity
- did anyone else feel like this book was PACKED and STUFFED to the seams with SO MUCH diversity bc the whiners have been whining about it since book 1 ???
- bc it felt so forced for me
- really didnâ€™t like it
- didnâ€™t help me with plot AT ALL
- like stop; if you hadnâ€™t intended to have such diverse characters; then donâ€™t
- better to have proper representation than bad representation
- and thatâ€™s what I feel happened here
- stop PRESSURING authors to include diverse characters sheesh
- let people write
-
- Rant #3: A MATE FOR YOU; A MATE FOR YOU; AND A MATE FOR YOU TOO
- in case you missed it
- its war time in ACOWAR so why everyone need to have mates at THIS VERY moment
- I have no clue
- its just weird cause you would THINK when the world is burning
- that people think past sex and try to think of â€œsurvivalâ€
- or nahhhh
- survival is overrated
-
- Rant #4: Cringey Smut
- please im begging you
- stop the smut
- its tasteless
- its unnecessary
- and its DISRESPECTFUL LEAVE THE LIBRARY ALONE
- THE LIBRARY DID NOTHING TO DESERVE THIS
- PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO LIVE THEIR LIVES NOT WATCH YOU REPRODUCE
- get out
- every other chapter had some â€œfeastingâ€ scene and I was like lol nope bye
-
- Rant #5: crashing and burning (view spoiler)
- I still am and will forever be salty about this
- bc I could care less about rhys and feyre feasting on each other
- I was only here for these two
- And it crashed and burned right before my eyes
- Dropping a star for that oops
-
- And a whole bunch of other stuff that made me seethe but not like an active seething bc after I heard about rant #5 taking place my investment in this series dropped from 110% to 35%
- Yes im being petty
- Fite me
- (à¸‡ â€¢Ì€_â€¢Ì)à¸‡
Anyways; there were a lot of things I enjoyed about this book; like the sibling bondings and I cried a lot too and there were sappy parts that had me squealing but the more I think about it the more my happy memory turns mistier and I remember the crap that made me roll my eyes and want to chuck the book (see: mate) and im just going to cry to get rid of any remaining emotions that might be lingering
3 stars!!

â€œOnly you can decide what breaks you; Cursebreaker. Only you.â€
Let me talk to you about this book. This book KILLED ME. This book DESTROYED ME. This book ANNIHILATED ME. This book OBLITERATED ME. This book ELIMINATED ME. This book WIPED ME OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH. This book EXTERMINATED ME. This book ERADICATED ME. I will never recover. How can I function after this fucking book? I was supposed to read it slowly because A Court of Frost and Starlight will arrive here after a week and I have had serious issues waiting for those books in the past; but I couldn't stop. The last 300 pages were marvelous; they gripped me by the balls and took me with them on this amazing journey. I was reading till 6am yesterday. No regrets. The feels are always heightened this ungodly time of day. And I'm so happy I read this book at that time. But let's start from the very beginning.
Looming war threatens all Feyre holds dear in the third volume of the #1 New York Times bestselling A Court of Thorns and Roses series.
Feyre has returned to the Spring Court; determined to gather information on Tamlin's manoeuvrings and the invading king threatening to bring Prythian to its knees. But to do so she must play a deadly game of deceit â€“ and one slip may spell doom not only for Feyre; but for her world as well.
As war bears down upon them all; Feyre must decide who to trust amongst the dazzling and lethal High Lords â€“ and hunt for allies in unexpected places.
This book started off strong enough. I was extremely excited about Feyre infiltrating Tamlin's Court and taking him down. She would be such a badass. I expected this part of the book to be bigger; to be honest. About 250 pages; to be exact. I really enjoyed the scheming; the planning; the cleverness of Feyre; how she turned everyone against one another so brilliantly. I hated Tamlin and Ianthe more in this part of the book; obviously. They were both manipulative; controlling and toxic. They truly deserved each other. Lucien gained some respect from me in this part of the book. I was really disappointed in him in A Court of Mist and Fury.
Afterwards; the pace of the book gets a bit slower than I would have wanted. I expected it to happen; because the ""format"" of these books is always the same; for me at least. A very powerful beginning; then the pace lags a little bit and in the end the true BAM! But it was different for me in this book. I didn't feel the same excitement its predecessor gave me (till page 400). And I understand why. The previous book opened up a whole entire different world to me. From the Spring Court and everything we thought we knew was right; everything changed. And we start off getting to know everything in the Night Court; and it was all exhilarating. As much and even more as it was getting to know the entire world of everything in the first book. Getting to know Rhysand and his true incentives; the inner circle; the world; seeing the romance bloom between Rhysand and Feyre. In this book; everything is settled. We know everyone; the world; the romance is stable. There aren't as many new things happening; except when we get to page 400. Till this page; I would have given this book 4 stars; which is low for this series for me; because I LIVE FOR IT.
I'm going to talk a bit about the first 400 pages; before my favorite part of the book starts. After Feyre arrived in the Night Court with Lucien; everything took a certain pace. We got to feel Velaris again; the inner circle; Rhysand; the conflict; the problems. A gargantuan War is coming; and they had to deal with it. Gather allies; forge a plan; make actions; bargains. This entire chunk of the book was about the war and how they would end it. And I truly enjoyed that but it didn't keep me on my toes; you know? Till page 400.
PAGE 400. THAT'S WHERE THE REAL SHIT STARTS. And then we got to page 400. When the meeting starts. This is the part I couldn't leave the book down. The part where if anyone commanded me to leave the book down; I would have killed them. Like fucking Feyre would. This meeting was so enthralling. The tension was keeping me enraptured the entire time. I'm content that we got to know the other High Lords of Prythian; we got a better understand of the world and its people. They were all truly incredible characters (except Beron); especially Helion. I loved his humor; his swag and that he's bisexual. I noticed something very important in this book. There was more representation. Not enough but more. We got to see black characters; bisexual characters; gay characters; lesbian characters (MOR I LOVE YOU SO MUCH; I'M SO PROUD OF YOU GIRL). This series isn't known for its diversity; but it was nice to see some more examples popping up. It was refreshing.
But anyway; let's continue with the meeting. I was so proud of all my Night Court babies; how they handled it. Each question a challenge that was met brilliantly. IF I COULD I WOULD STAND UP AND APPLAUD AZRIEL FOR ATTACKING ERIS. FUCKING ERIS. And also my Queen Feyre; who showed her true powers without fear of the High Lords. Of so many High Lords; who could easily kill her. And then Tamlin enters the Dawn Court room. I thought there was a limit to how much I hated him; but he surpassed that. His crude; distasteful and inappropriate comments were so unnecessary. Dude; we know how fucking butthurt you are that your girlfriend left you for a better man than you; but we're here to discuss how to prevent the War; your comments are fucking irrelevant. Be a better man for once and show some restraint. Now wonder even Lucien left you. Lucien. Oh man. Helion is Lucien's father. I was so fucking astonished. This book bestowed many plot twists for us; and this was one that gripped me tightly. I don't even know the reason; I just really like Lucien all of a sudden. More than I liked him in the first book. And I genuinely appreciated how he trusted Feyre; and how he acclimated himself to the Night Court. How he saw good in Rhysand and his people; after all the propaganda of the latest hundreds of years. How he wanted to be useful and help do something significant for the War.
I WANT TO DISCUSS HOW FEYRE IS SUCH A SHIPPER; IT HURTS. Feyre is like us. She ships her friends with each other and tries to make the ship happen. I'm so proud of her. I'm so proud that she actively participates in her friend's happiness. She ships everything I ship; and I couldn't not notice it; it's so obvious. I want her to succeed. I want her to find the best fucking girlfriend for Mor; cause my girl deserves happiness. They all deserve it; but her more; in the relationship factor. I'm very sorrowful that in this world; a lesbian woman can't thrive. It mirrors our own world; to be exact. Some people have the resources and the family behind to support them; and some people just; don't. Mor has been so unlucky in the romance department; with her cruel family stopping everything that she does. I want her to come out; and I want Feyre to be beside her and support her.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT NESTA AND CASSIAN. NESTA AND CASSIAN. The ship I was rooting for since the previous book. The ship that is killing my heart slowly and painfully. THEY HAVE TO BE MATES. PLEASE TELL ME THEY'RE MATES. And even if they're not; their dynamic is so strong. Their scenes so utterly powerful; even them staring at each other had me dying in my seat. I want them to thrive. They are my favorite couple; after Rhysand and Feyre; and I want them to prosper. There was such a gradual progress with them. Sarah handled this couple's dynamic amazingly. How we started seeing; little by little; how Nesta started caring more about Cassian. How gentle he was with her; with her feelings. He didn't push her; he didn't drive her to the edge. I want more of them; I want them to take over the world. Nesta is such a favorite character of mine. Strong; unyielding; snarky; flawed; raw; true. She is perfectly flawed; the way I like my characters to be. This book series doesn't favor flawed characters. Most of them are impeccable; outside and inside. But Nesta isn't. She still shows her humanity and I love her for it.
We talked about Nesta... now we have to talk about Elain. Useless; needless Elain. I didn't like her in this book. I loathed her moping around; her extremely extravagant sensitivity; her outmost obsolescence. I couldn't stand everyone defending and protecting her; all the fucking time. Oh poor little Elain; how bad must it be for you to be immortal; young and beautiful forever; aw I feel so sorry for you. She did something in the end by stabbing The Hybern King; but not something miraculous. Nesta integrated the action. I just didn't enjoy her character in this book; she was utterly annoying to me.
This War man... this War. It was the most tit gripping thing I have read in a very long time. The adrenaline was high up in heaven. It was jaw dropping; breathtaking; awe-inspiring. When the hope was lost; there would be hope; and when there was hope; it would be taken harshly out of our grip. There was so much shit happening; so many characters appearing; to help; to condemn. Strategies being thrown our the window; plans succeeding; failing; bargains breaking. There was just.. so much happening. I couldn't keep track of everything. The action was astounding; the plot twists out of this world; the thrill spectacular. I devoured these chapters in a heartbeat. I wasn't even looking at the pages or chapters; or even time; I was just reading. This book was a true and amazing ending to an incredible series. I'm so happy I picked these books up. This series made me love fantasy again. I have stopped being a fan of fantasy for many many years; and these books reintroduced me to its virtues. I WANT TO READ MORE FANTASY BECAUSE OF THESE BOOKS YEAH.
RHYS'S DEATH GUYS. It happened in page 666; how convenient. I didn't feel a heartbeat for a minute. I know he would survive because he's in the next book; but you know how it is. I was utterly heartbroken by Feyre's reaction. She made me feel what she was feeling. I cried. Literally. And hear me out a bit. This is a huge deal for me. I never cry with books. The only books I have ever cried about are the Harry Potter series and the Outlander series. Which are my all time favorite books of all the fucking universe. When I started crying; I was so surprised at myself. I was so happy I did. Because Rhys has become one of my all time favorite characters; and seeing his demise broke me. Like Feyre's heart was broken. And then Tamlin gives his last speck of light and saves him. Let's talk about him and his redemption arc.
You have seen my feelings about him in the fist part of this review. In the end; they shifted; just a bit. I truly appreciated how he helped Feyre; how he saved her. And how he saved Rhysand's life. I don't like him; but I value how he got over his grudge; and actually helped everyone; for the good of Prythian. I forgive you; Tamlin; you're still a piece of shit of a character with many unsolved issues; but as Feyre said
â€œI hope you find happiness; too.'
""And I did. Not just for what he'd done for Rhys; but...Even for an immortal; there was not enough *time* in life to waste it on hatred. On feeling it and putting it into the world.
So I wished him well -- I truly did; and hoped that one day...One day; perhaps he would face those insidious fears; that destructive rage rotting away inside him.â€
You get a pass; bitch. I'm curious of what will happen to his relationship with Lucien. It will be interesting.
I have written 12000 words for this review. And 8000 are left. I will surpass Goodread's character limit. Lmao. I had so much to say about this book; the ending of a marvelous series. I couldn't help myself and I'm very sorry for this chaos of a review. My feels are still raw and unedited. And if you're reading this right now; you're a true hero for going through all of this shittone. And I love you for it.
To sum it all up; this book was a truly magnificent journey and an incredible ending to a wonderful series. I'm literally speechless; and I will think about this book a lot. For a very long time. Nothing else more I can say; this review explains it all. I will crawl now to my bed and die peacefully of the feels. And till the next one... K BYE!

I think we all wait for that one time though; that one time when it ends right.
Maybe this can be it.
There are those books that are important and timely; worthy of reading because of the social and/or political message that they send. They fill a gap in the market; they make waves. They need to exist. And there are other books that are well-written; emotionally-charged and unputdownable - books that are not important as such; just really fucking good. But; on occasion; you find one of those rare wonderful creatures that is both important AND really fucking good.
The Hate U Give is one of those books.
I could tell you that this book is inspired by the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement. I could tell you that it rips unapolegetically into a subject that needed to be ripped into - the shootings of unarmed black people by police officers; as well as racial bias in the justice system. I could tell you that it opened my eyes to aspects of white privilege I never considered. All of that needs to be said; for sure; but I feel like I'm doing this book a disservice by highlighting its sociopolitical importance over the fact that it's also a fantastic; powerful and utterly unforgettable book.
I don't know what your experiences were as a child; but when I was young; I remember my parents giving me a talk about how if I was ever lost or in trouble; I should look for a police officer. They would protect me; look after me; and make sure I got back to my parents unharmed. They are the people in society we should be able to trust. But the black protagonist of this book - Starr - gets a very different talk. About how to behave around police officers so she doesnâ€™t get arrested. Or shot.
Unfortunately; her friend - Khalil - never got that talk.
Iâ€™ve seen it happen over and over again: a black person gets killed just for being black; and all hell breaks loose. Iâ€™ve Tweeted RIP hashtags; reblogged pictures on Tumblr; and signed every petition out there. I always said that if I saw it happen to somebody; I would have the loudest voice; making sure the world knew what went down.
Now I am that person; and Iâ€™m too afraid to speak.
The Hate U Give is about how Starr deals with the aftermath of witnessing Khalil being shot by a cop for... doing absolutely nothing wrong. Her fear is palpable as she confronts a system that she knows is working against her. She's afraid to speak out; yet angry that Khalil's murderer could escape justice. We see; through Starr's eyes; how the media presents young black men as guilty until proven innocent - and when you're poor; black; and from a rough neighborhood; it's virtually impossible to appear innocent.
Though; at its heart; this book first and foremost captures the perspective of a scared young girl. A girl with a loving family; complicated friendships with white teenagers at her school; and a white boyfriend. The relationship dynamics run alongside the fight for justice and are no less compelling. Thomas deftly portrays complex; nuanced relationships between all the people in the book; considering the divides between Starr and her white classmates; but never allowing anyone to become cliche or one-dimensional.
Little humorous gems lay scattered throughout the dialogue:
Momma reaches her fork onto my plate and breaks off a piece of pancake. â€œWhat is Tumblr anyway? Is it like Facebook?â€
â€œNo; and youâ€™re forbidden to get one. No parents allowed. You guys already took over Facebook.â€
â€œYou havenâ€™t responded to my friend request yet.â€
â€œI know.â€
â€œI need Candy Crush lives.â€
â€œThatâ€™s why Iâ€™ll never respond.â€
It's incredible how The Hate U Give manages to both break your heart and warm it in the space of just a few pages.
What else can I even say? If you want to have your heart ripped out - read this book. If you want to read a great book about a girl dealing with family and relationships - read this book. If you want to cry; laugh; and then cry some more - read this book. If you're ready to change this stupid fucking world - read this book.

I finished The Hate U Give a while back; rated it two stars; but never dared write any of my thoughts about it - why? Because every single review I've seen of this book is 4 stars or above and showers it in seemingly endless praise. When it seems like you're the only person in the world who didn't like a book; reviewing it can be a little intimidating.
Also; this book focused on an incredibly sensitive topic nowadays - racism. Now; before I start making my points and telling you why I didn't like a book that is supposedly anti-racism; when I; myself; am anti-racist; let's go over the definition of ""racism."" According to the dictionary; racism is the prejudice; discrimination; or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.
If someone works at a coffeeshop and a customer comes in of a different race and they treat them badly; because of their race; that's racist. If someone says ""you're stupid because you're ___ (insert race here);"" that's racist. If someone thinks they're better than you simply because of the color of that person's skin; that's racism; folks.
Now; if a person were to stop talking with someone because they felt uncomfortable with that person's skin color; wouldn't that be racism? Wouldn't treating someone with hostility just because of their race; something they can't help; and are born with; be racist? Then what; I ask you; is this:
â€œYou canâ€™t even tell me whatâ€™s going on!â€
â€œYouâ€™re white; okay?â€ I yell. â€œYouâ€™re white!â€
Silence.
â€œIâ€™m white?â€ he says; like heâ€™s just hearing that for the first time. â€œWhat the f***â€™s that got to do with anything?â€
The person who said ""you're white;"" who has no other reason besides this prejudice to be angry and stop talking to a white person; is Starr Carter; the narrator of this supposedly anti-racist book.
After Starr's black friend; Khalil; is unjustly shot by a white police officer; Starr immediately zeroes in on the fact that the police officer was white. Suddenly every white person looks evil to her and she worries that she; a black girl; could be killed next.
â€œI kneel beside my dead friend in the middle of the street with my hands raised. A cop as white as Chris points a gun at me.
As white as Chris.â€
Now; I love that this book focused on an unjust police shooting; but I think the author took a wrong turn when she decided to focus on ""blacks"" and ""whites."" My question is: why was the police officer's skin color the main focus of this book? Shouldn't the fact that he's a police officer who unjustly shot somebody be the reason for Starr getting so angry about her friend's death? Black people are unjustly shot by police officers; yes; but so are white people. To quote a good article about the statistics of police shootings that you can read here:
â€œâ€¦When a black man is killed by a cop; do we grieve more because there are 46 million of us as opposed to 198 million whites? I doubt it: most Americans never hear about the white menâ€™s deaths at all.
Rather; we operate according to a meme under which cops casually kill black men under circumstances in which white men are apparently let off with a hand slapâ€”and occasional cases of just that are what often get around social media; suggesting that they are the norm.â€
It is not normal for a black person to be killed by a police officer; and when the officer won't own up to his mistake (like the one in this book); I am fully supportive of whatever non-violent protesting people want to do. What I won't support is the slogan that gets slapped on alongside these riots: All police officers hate black people or All white people are racist and should own up to their ""white guilt."" These statements are ludicrous and this book sent out both of those messages loud and clear.
*takes deep breath and prepares for the onslaught of comments coming my way*
Now that I'm done talking about the message; I can tell you what I thought about the book itself: It was boring. Seriously. I expected a fast-paced contemporary; but the plot was slow and the characters weren't developed enough for me to connect with them. With such weak writing; The Hate U Give could have been about rainbows and unicorns and I still would have given it two stars. (less)",32,NEXTBOOK

I absolutely adored this book. I truly don't feel like it has a single flaw. Every topic addressed was approach so wonderfully and did not hold back. If you're looking for a diverse read that stands out amongst most YA; The Hate U Give is the book for you.
I love Starr Carter so much. She's honestly such an inspiration to girls looking to find their voice. She is resilient; authentic; and everything we need in adolescents today. Although she is not completely fearless; she embraces the adversity in her way and stands against it. I don't know many people who could juggle the stresses in her life and come out weapons (in this case; words) blazing. Every moment in this book just filled me with pride for this girl and it was a pleasure being able to watch her grow.
I also love the family dynamic in this book. I think it honestly might be the most healthy; realistic; close-knit family I've ever read in a YA. The siblings may tease each other; but they protect each other fiercely. The parents may not always get along; but they are head over heels in love. They always attempt to do what is best for their children; even if it may not be their own personal preference. It was so nice to have just a scene of a family sitting down to watch sports together; throwing a pool party; always working together. It is something I truly valued from this read.
The strongest aspect of this book is it's social commentary and political criticism. This is the kind of book that should be in the hands of teens; making them aware of current issues; educating them on pressing matters; and encouraging them to get involved to create change. I absolutely left this read with an entirely new perspective I will carry with me in the future. It poses many important questions about racism; police brutality; discrimination; and prejudice while also answering them in a comprehensive and inviting way. It was fascinating to see the integration of such a powerful movement implemented into an accessible form of media for teens. I truly don't think you can leave this book without SOMETHING that will have made you say ""I never thought about it this way""; ""When you put it this way; that actually makes a lot of sense.""; and ""I'm glad someone finally told me this.""
Although this book is full of important moments related to the current state of marginalized populations; it is primarily about using your voice. I believe this book has the power to make readers realize just how much their words matter. Starr Carter is a perfect example of an individual who feels their voice does not matter but through courage; risk-taking; and ultimate strength; she realizes how crucial it is to speak up for what you are passionate about no matter how terrifying the consequences may seem. And I believe you will leave this book with that revelation as well.
I cannot recommend this book enough. It's absolutely one of my favorite books of the year. I am so happy The Hate U Give exists; and I'm even more ecstatic that it is a 1! NYT best seller; out in to the world; ready to help teens realize how important they really are. Please pick up ""THUG"". You will not regret it. (less)",33,NEXTBOOK

Every white person on this planet needs to read this book.
""Lack of opportunities. Corporate America don't bring jobs to our communities; and they damn sure ain't quick to hire us. Then; even if you do have a high school diploma; so many schools in our neighbourhoods don't prepare us well enough. Our schools don't get the resources to equip you. It's easier to find some crack than it is to find a good school around here.
Now think 'bout this. How did the drugs even get in our neighborhood? This is a multibillion-dollar industry. That shit is flown into our communities but I don't know anybody with a private jet.
Drugs come from somewhere; and they're destroying our community.
You got folks like Brenda; who think they need them to survive; and then you got the Khalils; who think they need to sell them to survive. The Brendas can't get jobs unless they're clean; and they can't pay for rehab unless they get jobs. When the Khalils get arrested for selling drugs; they either spend most of their life in prison; another billion-dollar industry; or they have a hard time getting a real job and probably start selling drugs again.
That's the hate they're giving us; a system designed against us. That's Thug life.""
This book opened my eyes. I don't want to say too much; but I love how popular this book is; being No. 1 on the NYT bestseller list and already having cast Amandla Stenberg as the lead actress in the movie adaption. We need this; America needs this; YA fiction needs this. Angie Thomas gets so many things right; and so many readers can learn about black culture; cultural appropriation; covert and internalized racism and so much more through this.
Apart from that; this book is simply good. It could be a biography; that's how realistic it feels. The characters have depth; the plot isn't overly dramatic but still exciting. And honestly; it's so so hilarious. Doesn't matter if the characters are joking about Voldemort or getting their butts whooped by their parents; it's laugh-out-loud material. The first few pages might be a little difficult to get through because it takes a while to get used to the writing and the slang; but keep going; it's worth it. The thing is; I wasn't overly emotional while reading this. I didn't cry ugly tears; didn't have my heart broken. This is no TFIOS. But it's real and it's perfect.
Another thing I love is when authors turn out to be huge Potterheads. There is nothing I enjoy more than a good Harry Potter reference; or five.

This doesnâ€™t make any sense. And I hope that to you; too; it will not make any sense.
Starr may only be sixteen; but she has already witnessed two murders in her life: the first of a young black girl in a drive by and the second of a young black boy shot multiple times by a cop.
While she was in the car. Even though they didnâ€™t do anything wrong. Even though he was unarmed.
â€â€A hairbrush is not a gun.â€™â€™
Does that make any sense to you? You canâ€™t just kill someone because; to you; they look threatening. Are you a seer? Can you predict that they will reach for a gun and kill you with it?
No; you cannot. (Even then it wouldnâ€™t be completely right.) You have no right to take an innocent life like that.
Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement; this important novel tackles issues of race in society involving the black community of people and authority figures; more precisely; police officers.
Starr was never taught to fear cops; but she was taught to be smart around them. Do what they ask; even if what they ask for makes no sense.
But because of what has happened to her childhood friend Khalil; she becomes scared. Scared enough to speak up about what she witnessed; though? Will she gather her courage to do what is right?
â€â€A hairbrush is not a gun.â€™â€™
This story needed to be told. It has been told orally and on paper many times before; unfortunately; but it was time someone wrote a book dealing with social issues of race like the ones here for a young audience.
For young people are dying. Young black people. Black boys. Black girls.
This novel educates. It may be fictional in the sense that Angie Thomas created this story using fictional characters; but what happens in it is scary real.
It does feel like it was written for white folks; but it sure as hell didnâ€™t need to be written for black ones specifically.

â€”
When you're reading books like The Hate U Give; you're reading someone's decision against silence. This book has made me feel every single possible emotion at the same time. It was truly incredible and I have SO MUCH to say about it I wish I could actually just send everyone a howler containing the entire script of this book instead.
â€œWhat's the point of having a voice if you're gonna be silent in those moments you shouldn't be?â€
In all honesty; The Hate U Give has made me realize just how simply clueless I was as to the continuing day-to-day actuality of systemic racism in America. A reality in which on any given day; some innocent person like Tommy Le can get shot hours before his high-school graduation because he was carrying a pen; or another innocent person like Sandra Bland can get into a car; and then three days later she is going to end up dead in jail; or a five years old child can get shot and wounded after the police kills his mother. A reality in which justice is dead and the police kills black youth with impunity.
And so many other real stories I read about that truly made the atoms making up my body have enough of being anchored to this awful reality in this human form and wish to move on; become a light wave or something.
See; I donâ€™t know what it's like to be black in America; but I have 18 years of experience in being a brown Muslim woman and I can tell you this: being in the minority is like being stuck behind a glass wall and whenever an injustice occurs; you breathe onto it and you write it in HUGE letters in the condensation...but nobody seems to really see it. Nobody seems to really see you. Youâ€™re completely and utterly alone.
(x)
The Hate U Give is about institutional racism and a broken criminal justice system where the police can violate the civil rights of thousands of people publicly and openly with almost no consequence at all. It's about what happens when racialized and marginalized communities stand up for their rights in any visible way whatsoever. Itâ€™s about how piles and piles of evidence showing sustained corruption and racism and literally hundreds of civilian deaths per year at the hands of the police is still somehow not enough to delegitimize a deeply flawed system.
It's about how instead of standing in unwavering solidarity with the non-violent protests by Black Lives Matter in the face of actually violent; overtly discriminatory and often fatal actions by the police and demanding societal redress and justice; there will always be people who will decry and get enraged by it; people who will try to justify those injustices by any means to curb their own cognitive dissonance.
â€œA hairbrush is not a gun.â€
I mean; this is the 21st century. We evolved. America had elected its first black president. Humanity must've left â€racismâ€™ back up in the trees from the jungles we descended from.... right?
Maybe there just aren't many â€œsocial experimentsâ€ on YouTube where privileged folks get to dress up like oppressed groups and have cameras following them around in order to find out that racism is real; since apparently you really need the personal account of a white non-Muslim girl who tries on a hijab for a week to find out that racism and islamophobia do indeed exist; or a straight person pretending to be gay to find out that homophobia does exist; or an able-bodied person pretending to be disabled to find out that ableism does exist.
You don't need any â€œsocial experimentsâ€ to understand oppression. You donâ€™t need to plagiarize lived experiences when you can just listen. Not to the personal accounts filtered through a white person but listen to the testimonials of all the people of color across the globe who experience these issues first hand - no matter what their socio-economic standing is; and who are ignored when they actually reach out to educate you even though they shouldn't even have to.
No one should have to debate about whether or not they should have basic human rights.
No one should be expected to be the mouth piece for an entire group.
No one should have to defend their humanity at every single step; repeatedly and constantly.
But racism does exist.
And I don't usually comment on other people's reviews; but if youâ€™ve read this book and chose to ignore the important message it conveys to get offended over the main characterâ€™s remark about the way white people call 'target' tar-jay and â€œhey hey thatâ€™s racist!â€ because you think a harmless joke could possibly equate thousands of black lives unjustly killed every year at the hands of the police; or say â€œbut what if it was the other way around?"" when you have zero concept of power dynamics and historical context; you are missing the point.
Now you can justify your outrage by bringing up the definition of racism like Iâ€™ve seen so many people do; but I donâ€™t think dictionary definitions will help you there when they are the most basic forms of words and often canâ€™t even be taken in a sociological sense.
Just like how they wonâ€™t help with the usual cries of â€reverse racismâ€™ or even the moronic nonsense like trying to claim that anti-Islamic bigotry is not racist because â€œIslam is not a raceâ€.
It wonâ€™t change the fact that members of marginalized groups suffer under the yoke of all forms of social inequality; from racism to misogyny to ableism to so much more on a daily basis.
It won't change the fact that these words are a constant; inevitable factors of the lives of the minority; all found on different levels of existence; all carrying various levels of trauma.
I think Scott Woods said it best when he said that racism is bigger than just â€œconscious hateâ€. That it might look like hate but it is just one manifestation. And privilege is another. Access is another. Ignorance is another. Apathy is another.
â€œYou can destroy wood and brick; but you can't destroy a movement.â€
Khalil's story is one I will never forget; just like I won't forget all the real stories this book has opened my eyes to.

I wanted to just clarify a few things from my original review bc I feel like some things were lost in translation ha
i'm not going to be like deleting mass amounts of the review; just adding like little captions for further explanation.
All the opinions are my own based off my life experience and knowledge as a Canadian PoC. I cannot talk on behalf of anyone else.
Anyways; just ignore me.
Update: you don't understand how fricken sorry I am for having this fricken review reappear on your feeds; honestly I've GENUINELY considered DELETING it bc of all the misery its caused in my life (that's what I get for having a fricken opinion) but then what would that show about this community being open minded and tolerant to different voices?
but I want to bring to attention something that I said some time ago in the comments that might have been perceived as hurtful and I honestly did not mean it in that way at all. (and no this isn't me trying to cover up anything; i'll explain)
So; I commented something along the lines of how 'the world is reaching a point where coloured people are becoming more privileged that white people' and honestly; as a person who fits in multiple minority groups and is not black or white; I didn't MEAN that in the way it came out. I honest to goodness meant it as a hyperbole and it was written in a moment of haste and frustration. NEVERTHELESS; I take full responsibility if i was misunderstood.
At the time; I was very irritated with the thread bc it felt like people were just commenting to insult me and had no care for my opinion or feelings or just any manners whatsoever. As you can probably see by scrolling through the comments (a lot of them are brash and immature) and I stopped replying and I even physically had to stop myself to coming back to read the comments bc they were making my life miserable.
But I do realize how it could be interpreted in a harmful manner and I apologize if it was.
Again; no one has to agree or believe me; I just wanted to take responsibility for my actions and be mature about it.
I'M REALLY SORRY THIS IS BACK ON YOUR FEED. PLEASE FORGIVE ME.
ACTUAL REVIEW:
Before you start this review Iâ€™d like to ask you to put on your Objective Glasses on for a moment.
Youâ€™re not obliged to agree with me or disagree with me; but I would most definitely appreciate if you hear my arguments before you go ahead and give judgement.

â€œIâ€™m white?â€ he says; like heâ€™s just hearing that for the first time. â€œWhat the f*ckâ€™s that got to do with anything?â€
â€œEverything! Youâ€™re white; Iâ€™m black. Youâ€™re rich; Iâ€™m not.â€
Secondly; towards the ending of the book (view spoiler) this conversation takes place:
â€œI swear; I donâ€™t understand white people.
Breadcrumbs on macaroni; kissing dogs on the mouthâ€”â€
â€œTreating their dogs like theyâ€™re their kids;â€ I add.
â€œYeah!â€ says DeVante. â€œPurposely doing shit that could kill them; like bungee jumping.â€
â€œCalling Target â€Tar-jay;â€™ like that makes it fancier;â€ says Seven.
â€œF*ck;â€ Chris mutters. â€œThatâ€™s what my mom calls it.â€
Seven and I bust out laughing.
â€œSaying dumb shit to their parents;â€ DeVante continues. â€œSplitting up in situations when they clearly need to stick together.â€
I understand that this scene is all in good fun; but it made me feel VERY uncomfortable while I was reading it.
Now I want you to use those objective glasses we talked about earlier and objectively tell me; that if this was reversed with races; everyone wouldnâ€™t be flipping crap over it; because Iâ€™m positive they would.
Hereâ€™s a rule I like the stick with: if Iâ€™d find it offensive if it was pinned on me; I donâ€™t speak it. Itâ€™s not worth it to hurt someone for a silly joke.
Now the reason why I found this to be irking to read was bc there was a moment in the book where a kid at school (i think it was Starr's friend??) made a fried chicken joke and another moment where someone made some stereotypical asian joke. They were both hurtful and gross and they were called out by the other characters! Rightfully so!
That's how harmful stereotypes should be dealt with; so seeing a scene where it's done; even in GOOD FUN; to a white person; it just...it feels wrong to me.
Exaggeration
Now most of the book felt very real. I was constantly impressed by how the author was able to convert reality into fiction; however there were parts of the book that I felt were just EXAGERATED in order to make the crime worse by tenfold.
So towards the ending; havoc is being wrecked and the kids are in a really tight situation and in a few seconds; they are able to snap some fingers (while also doing really silly; questionable ish and then in 10 pages EVERYTHING is solved and i was still left reeling (i'm sure people who read the book know what i'm referring to)
just; it seemed unrealistic and tiny of an ending for me
Personal Points
I found this book to be very LONG for a contemporary. It took me over 20 days to finish this book and I DONâ€™T take that long to finish books.
It lost my attention one too many times and I thought could be condensed down to a 300 paged book rather than 400+ pages.
*The whole thing with reverse racism is that people claim that because white people never faced a calamity on a racial scale; then racism cannot be committed against them. Well; letâ€™s take a trip down history lane. . .
. . .during the 19 and 20th century; Irish immigrants were treated like slaves in North America. They were called â€œfilthy peopleâ€ by the other citizens; they were depicted as gorillas in drawings; and they were refused work and housing on the SOLE basis that they were Irish.
^so many people have talked about the definition of racism/discrimination/xenophobia etc. and honestly this stuff hurts my brain so i won't get into that stuff but I'm really all over the place rn; so let's simplify.
Whatâ€™s my point?
My point is that I will stand against racism; but I will stand against all types of racism.
I will NOT stand for Black racism; or Brown racism; or Asian racism; or Arab racism; or White racism. One is as bad as the others and while I understand the message this book is trying to portray; making racist remarks about white people; even in passing; is not okay. Thatâ€™s defeating the whole purpose.
I've noticed a culture beginning to grow on social media esp. tumblr; twitter etc. in which people poke fun and say crap about white people with the idea that 'they are the race in control' so it's totally fine to make fun of them. And seriously guys its so icky.
WHY CANT WE JUST BE NICE TO EACH OTHER SHEESH.
Itâ€™s simple. Respect people; respect nations. Donâ€™t point fingers or pass the cruelty you faced on to another; that doesnâ€™t solve anything; it just makes it worse.
I want to be in a world where everyone is comfortable enough to be themselves and be proud of their ethnicity without feeling alienated and pointing fingers at each other does NOTHING to help that.
With that said; I AM NOT SAYING THIS BOOK IS RACIST.
IT IS N O T
ITS THE OPPOSITE OF RACIST
This review is just a girl ranting about her feelings; like how i do for every other book i read.
On a positive note; I do feel that this entire book has a very very very strong and important message and the author conveyed it beautifully. The positive family dynamics was one of the best Iâ€™ve ever read about in YA. I would 11/10 recommend this book.
It was very emotional to read about Starrâ€™s journey and I very much enjoyed the book but you donâ€™t need me to point of the positive aspects of this book. There are thousands of reviews doing just that; so that's why I reserved this review for the parts of the novel that made me uneasy.
(i hope this stuff has cleared up some of the misunderstandings some people might have thought)
in conclusion
- this book is so bloody important and i think everyone should read it
- however; just like with all pieces of literature; it can be criticized but that does not take away from the importance of the book
- so idk; chill
Thanks for listening all; Iâ€™d greatly appreciate your thoughts concerning the topic if you so please. :)
3.5 stars!!!

Just wow.
In my life so far; I've had the opportunity to experience many different things; but there are certain things I'll never get/have to experience. For example; I'll never experience childbirth; not that I'm complaining; although I once had a cortisone shot in my hip flexor; and my orthopedist said she thought those hurt just as badly. (You can debate on that.)
I'm also fortunate enough that I'll never have to worry about the police viewing me as a threat as soon as they see me; just because of the color of my skin. I'll never have to think about the possibility of a routine traffic stop turning into something more dangerous just because a policeman gets nervous. That's something I take for granted; but I won't now that I've read Angie Thomas' searing; powerfully moving The Hate U Give .
Starr is 16 years old. She feels like there are two of herâ€”the devoted daughter who lives in a poor neighborhood and saw her best friend get killed in a drive-by shooting when they were 10; and the student at the fancy prep school her parents sent her and her brothers to in order to get them out of the ghetto; the student who doesn't speak the way she does at home; and lets very few people into her ""real world."" Even her boyfriend at school; Chris; with whom she watches reruns of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air doesn't know the ""real"" Starr; although he says he wants to.
""Funny how it works with white kids though. It's dope to be black until it's hard to be black.""
One night while Starr is at a party in her neighborhood; she runs into her childhood friend Khalil. Khalil was her first crush; and although she hasn't seen him for a while; it feels good to reconnect. When a fight breaks out at the party; the two leave before things get out of hand. Not long afterward; police pull Khalil's car over; and before they know it; Khalil gets shot and killed by the cop. He was unarmed.
Khalil's death throws Starr and her family into a tailspin. The media has already branded Khalil a drug dealer and a thug. Starr doesn't feel like she can tell her friends at school what happened because that would be exposing them to a part of her she has tried to keep hidden; but she is angered by the attitude of one of her friends toward Khalil's shooting. Starr is afraid of the ramifications of telling the truth of what happened that night to police; prosecutors; everyoneâ€”what if police target her family? What if others think she should just keep her mouth shut? And will speaking up make the difference anyway; if most of the time white cops don't pay the price for shooting black people?
""I've tweeted RIP hashtags; reblogged pictures on Tumblr; and signed every petition out there. I always said that if I saw it happen to somebody; I would have the loudest voice; making sure the world knew what went down. Now I am that person; and I'm too afraid to speak.""
Starr's involvement in Khalil's death uncovers friction in a number of placesâ€”between her parents; who argue about the merits of getting their family out of their neighborhood versus their responsibility to making sure it doesn't die; between her father and his nemesis; the leader of a powerful gang; who is intertwined with Starr's family in too many different ways; between her and Chris; as well as her friends at school; and between the factions of their neighborhood and others in the community; some who riot for the sake of rioting and don't care what destruction they cause; and some who understand the power of their actions.
The Hate U Give is tremendously moving and just so current given what is happening in our society. While certainly it focuses on police brutality and the anger minorities feel when the authorities don't get punished for doing wrong; it is quick to point out that not all police are bad; just as not all black people are drug dealers; gang members; or looking to do harm. This is a book about racism; but it's also a book about family; friendship; loyalty; community; and how often it truly does take a village to save someone. This is a book that addresses the plight that many young black men face; but it doesn't place the blame on anyone but them; either.
I thought Thomas did a great job with this book; making sure it wasn't too heavy-handed in its messaging or too extreme in its plot. She created characters you grew to care about; characters you were invested in; so when pivotal events occurred; you were moved by them. This really blew my mind; and I think this is a book which really deserves all of the hype it is getting.
Several times in the book Starr's mother uttered the quote; ""Sometimes you can do everything right and things will still go wrong. The key is to never stop doing right."" I hope The Hate U Give reaches those despairing whether doing the right thing is still worth it even if it doesn't get the result they want. Because it really; truly is.

It is important; educational; and happening in our world right now as you're reading this review. If you can only read one book in 2017; please pick this one.
This book is inspired by the #BlackLivesMatter movement; where sixteen-year-old Starr witnesses her best friend; who is an unarmed black boy; be killed by a police officer. Starr is scared to speak up; constantly battling what to do; because there is never any justice for these heartless killings.
This book is real; honest; and it's going to make a lot of people uncomfortable; but being uncomfortable is necessary to change. And this book is going to change a lot of people's lives. I hope everyone reads this and starts educating themselves on; and will stop ignoring; the problems going on in today's world. Books are the most powerful and influential tool we have; and The Hate U Give is a literary masterpiece that will be a constant reference for years to come.
â€œThat's the problem. We let people say stuff; and they say it so much that it becomes okay to them and normal for us. What's the point of having a voice if you're gonna be silent in those moments you shouldn't be?â€
Important things that I want to say:
â€¢ Reverse racism doesn't exist.
â€¢ White people will never know what it feels like to be a marginalized black person who is still being oppressed in 2017. You might think you do; but you don't.
â€¢ When you say #AllLivesMatter; even when coming from a place of good; it is hurtful and ignoring the greater problems that are prevalent.
â€¢ When you say #BlueLivesMatter it actually makes me feel sick to my stomach; especially after reading this book. Stop doing this. I don't care if your dad is ""one of the good cops out there""; it is disrespectful for this plague of an epidemic that is happening to our black men and women.
â€¢ I can do better and I can do more. We can do better and we can all do more.
â€¢ Here is a list of some unarmed black men that have been killed over the past few years by the police brutality that is ever growing in the United States: Trayvon Martin; Michael Brown; Eric Garner; Dontre Hamilton; Eric Garner; John Crawford III; Michael Brown Jr.; Michael Brown Jr.; Dante Parker; Akai Gurley; Tamir Rice; Rumain Brisbon; Jerame Reid; Tony Robinson; Phillip White; Eric Harris; Walter Scott; Freddie Gray; Keith Lamont Scott; Philando Castile; Alton Sterling; and more that go unnamed and unanswered every day.
Remember these names. Honor these names. Open your eyes. See what is going on in our world and see how wrong it is. It is easy to ignore when it is not happening to you; but is this really the kind of world you want to live in? Open your heart; be empathetic to your fellow human. Let's change this; and have The Hate U Give be the first stepping stone.
â€œYou can destroy wood and brick; but you can't destroy a movement.â€
Thank you; Angie Thomas; I truly hope your book changes this world.
Lastly; I want to emphasize that this review is coming to you from a young; white; immensely privileged woman. These are five amazing people of color giving amazing heartfelt reviews on YouTube that showcases why this book is the most important and influential book of our time. Here are a few of the people we should need to be listening to:

And you know what? It is 5000% WORTHY of that hype and more and basically get thee to this book and read it as soon as possible. It perfectly combines a really important story about #BlackLivesMatter and speaking up for it with absolutely excellent writing and storytelling. Like; dude; this book is important and one of the best contemporaries.
So I have to admit: the character are what makes it that just something incredibly special for me. Starr was SO winning and rootable (shh that's a word) and I loved how she was so complex and had such personality and was so honestly relatable. And then the book focuses SO much on family!! Be still my beating heart. <3 I looooove books about family and Starr has the kind of parents YA is in desperate need of: in love; supportive; respectful of each other; and bringing their kids up the best they can be. LIKE HOLD ME I'M FLAILING.
(Also it was really refreshing to have teens that respect their parents...because I can't tell you how sick I am of how many books I encounter were the kids are just selfish disrespectful jellyfish. That wasn't how I was brought up so it's like nice to see kids who can talk to their parents about anything; LOVE THEM FIERCELY; and also do not dare muck up too bad or they'll get in huge trouble. I love it.) Basically Starr calls her parents her OTP and....dude yes.
I also absolutely adored all the secondary characters. Like they were ALL so real and complex?!?? It wasn't like ""oh here I am reading a piece of paper"". More like ""oh here I am being with these humans who are like totally alive to me"". SO THAT'S INCREDIBLE. A+ for writing at every corner basically. And I absolutely adored Starr's older brother Seven; and Sekani the younger bro was adorable too although entirely annoying...as younger siblings are. And then Starr had an epic Asian friend (and also a racist friend whom we all want to kind of smack into the middle of next week...that gets dealt with tho). And even DeVante was just adorable and I love how his story line went.
Oh oh see this is the thing?!?? EVERY character had their own storyline. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. And that's why this book is so good and the story so real.
OTHER LIST OF THINGS I LOVED:
â€¢ Starr has friends who are women; like god bless; this shouldn't be irregular but it is in a lot of books
â€¢ there is SO MUCH FOOOOOOOOOD
â€¢ Starr has a super sweet relationship with her uncle as well
â€¢ It's funny!! It's such a serious story line but there are still quips and TONS of time where I was grinning like a dork
â€¢ It's #ownvoices
â€¢ It's unfair but it also shines light into the world; so I feel sad but GOOD finishing it and I think it just sent an excellent message in a really hopeful way
I do have to admit two things were not my favourite. And that would be (1) it's very long...I have yet to meet a contemporary that is nearly 500 pages that I think should be that long. Erm; SORRY. Concise = my friend. And (2) I didn't feel very much chemistry AT ALL between Starr and her white boyfriend; Chris. They both seemed to be a bit of a problem to each other. But ya know; it's a sweet romance and I didn't not ship it; I just think it was definitely the weakest part of the book. (view spoiler)
Also I really learnt a lot about the #BlackLivesMatter movement. It was really good to just be reading this and knowing it's #ownvoices and just taking it all in. The horror that is the justice system is so sickening. And I was so scared for everyone's lives and just knowing HOW REAL THIS IS made an impact. No one should have a friend die in front of them; and Starr has it happen twice. It's heartbreaking. This is such an important book. It tackles racism and police violence and the corrupt justice system head on.
ALL IN ALL: go read it; obviously. I mean; what else is there to say?!?? The writing is beautiful and incredible; there are so many perfect sentences that I was underlining in my kindle; and I loved Starr and her incredibly family so much. <3 It's a SAD book but also a HOPEFUL one.
(And mate; I'm a fantasy reader addict; so look at me go; loving a contemporary so much.)
*** QUOTES ***
Note: these are taken from an ARC so don't use them anywhere! They might not be the final edits!
""Brave doesn't mean you're not scared; Starr;"" she says. ""It means you go on even though you're scared. And you're doing that.""
""So she unfollowed your Tumblr thingy;"" Momma says; proving why she can never have one.
I feel like shit right now. I can't believe I let Hailey say that. Or has she always joked like that? Did I always laugh because I thought I had to?
That's the problem. We let people say stuff; and they say it so much that it becomes okay to them and normal for us. What's the point of having a voice if you're gonna be silent in those moments you shouldn't be?
Funny. Slave masters thought they were making a difference in black people's lives too. Saving them from their ""wild African ways"". Same shit; different century. I wish people like them would stop thinking that people like me need saving.
""Daddy; you're the worst person to watch Harry Potter with. The whole time you're talking about"" -- I deepen my voice '''Why don't they shoot the nigga Voldemort?'""
""Ay; it don't make sense that in all them movies and books; nobody thought to shoot him.""
""Sometimes you can do everything right and things will still go wrong. The key is to never stop doing right.""

i rarely read realistic YA - if iâ€™m going to read YA; i prefer fantasy or survival stuff where teens are in peril. but this was recommended to me by too many people to put aside ""for later;â€ and while there are plenty of teens in peril; this sure ainâ€™t fantasy.
it earns every one of its rave reviews; itâ€™s an important; timely book that doesnâ€™t feel as though it was thrown together in order to cash in on its timeliness. something like this couldâ€™ve easily skewed exploitative or preachy; and it doesnâ€™t. at all. this was not thrown together; this was crafted. the voice is there; the emotional depth is there; itâ€™s got strata for days; and its adaptation potential is a no-brainer - the family and neighborhood warmth-with-warts of spike lee (and my heart recognizes none but delroy lindo as maverick carter); and the focus of kids caught up in/on the outskirts of the game of the wire with a female gaze both of those (largely) lack.
itâ€™s smart; occasionally subtle food for thought with plenty of appeal for adult readers. iâ€™d go on; but iâ€™m so late to reading this; iâ€™m just one more admiring voice in a sea of positive response; and if you are even later than me; reading my garbage-words is just keeping you from reading this; and thatâ€™s no good.

My typical days are like boot camp lately -walking between 7-10 miles a day -PLUS an hour circuit weight resistance class ( 4 mile walk to class from my house) -- then I often walk to a cafe - eat & drink something - check-in with Goodreads -- try to touch base with this community- a few 'one-on- one' chatting exchanges--during my sitting break.
Sometimes I try to talk into the phone while I walk. Typos exposed!
Before walking to my weight residence class - I'm often at the gym at 5 AM-- a few weights & stretching to begin - then an hour to 90 minutes of cardio 'while' reading from my paper white -
BEFORE THAT....I've read in bed a few hours 'before' the gym....
Exhausted yet? For relaxation-- I've added back an OLD FARTS YOGA CLASS.....AN EASY CLASS .... much too easy for me --but it's perfect! The breathing alone and time for inner blessings -private time to experience being 'one' with the world - hoping to be a better person; is worth the extra time spent in class. I send out blessings to family & friends while I'm in my own space on my own yoga mat. ( very private & personal but real for me)....
Why am I sharing this? I retired from traditional reviews--- but I may write a few NON- TRADITIONAL REVIEWS as my way to feel connected with people here I love and am forever thankful for!!!
After receiving the crappy diagnosis of osteoporosis on July 3rd this year --I knew I had to make changes. Take the yucky medication - and not fight it.. GET THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF CALCIUM in my diet not under-eat... and get out of the chair. Writing reviews that take an hour or more won't build bone density.
So-- I started downloading as many audiobooks I could get my hands on - free- from the library overdrive. I paid for a few too. Getting ready for walking- moving daily boot camp - reading included.
When I finished ""The Hate U Give"".... taking my turn at this book; which I recommend everyone take THEIR TURN; ....I still had about 1 more mile walk home. I was DYING TO CONNECT WITH MY DAUGHTERS. This book did that to me.
So.... HOW DOES A MOM CONNECT WITH THEIR ADULT KIDS WHEN THEY ARE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY - and they can't talk at the moment?
Perfect solution: play music that reminds you of them!!!
So-- I immediately listen to Aerosmith; ""Don't Want to Miss A Thing""; from Armageddon---Ali insisted on playing that song as her 'opening song' at her Bat Mitzvah.....nothing Jewish about it!- and we have a luv/thing with Aerosmith together.
For Katy - I played ""Someone Else's Story"" from the Broadway Musical ""Chess"". It's such a beautiful song ( listen to it). Katy use to sing it often! She always brings tears to my eyes when she sings it. Her voice is beautiful.
And how does ANY OF THIS RELATE TO ""The Hate You Give""? I have no idea ....
other than all these emotions - thoughts & feelings ARE ASSOCIATED with THIS BOOK.
Somehow they are all tied together!!!!

'The Hate U Give' addresses the very sensitive issues of race relations and police brutality in a time when the nation is torn over these issues. Most of my friends are at one extreme or the other when it comes to the #Blacklivesmatter movement. Since I don't want to incite an online mobbing; I'm going to do my best to avoid that movement specifically; while sharing my thoughts and opinions on this wonderful book.
First of all; this is a very moving story. It centers on a teenage black girl; Starr Carter; who leaves her crime-riddled neighborhood each day to attend an affluent school across town. In both settings; she feels a need to conform to the social norms. This means that she lives a double-life of sorts -- she has one persona with her black family and friends in her neighborhood and another one with her wealthy; predominantly white; friends from her school.
One night she attends a party in her neighborhood that turns violent. After leaving the party with her childhood friend; Khalil; her life and her community is forever changed. A routine traffic stop turns tragic when an unarmed Khalil is repeatedly shot by a police officer after failing to follow police instructions.
The events of that night serve as the spark that sets off an explosion. Starr's neighborhood has a long-standing animosity for the police; citing multiple instances of police brutality and harassment. The death of Khalil is only the latest in a long line of atrocities.
Begrudgingly; Starr is forced into the center of a media feeding frenzy. Part of her wishes that she could just hide and return to her ""old"" life; while another part wants to be brave and stand up for what she believes is right. She was in an extremely difficult situation for a young girl.
Although she initially tries to remain anonymous; as the sole witness of Khalil's murder she eventually speaks out publicly. Doing so; Starr learns a lot about herself and the people that she surrounds herself with. Some will stick around to support her; others will reveal that they were never really who she thought they were.
While this book certainly highlighted the issue of police brutality against blacks; there were several other takeaways for me. I applaud the author for not shying away from other issues that are controversial. For example; racism - against multiple races - was prevalent throughout this story. I appreciated that the author was forthcoming in addressing this topic; even knowing that it would likely be controversial. Two wrongs don't make a right. Racism is still racism and it is wrong; regardless of the race.
Although I did find the danger of Starr's neighborhood to be exaggerated; the author also highlighted the issue of violent crime; drugs and gang warfare. Several times; there were drive-by shootings or other crimes committed in Starr's neighborhood by the residents against the residents. It was sad and the author did a good job of highlighting this issue/cycle of violence.
One notable; older man in the story commented on this and I couldn't have agreed with him more. There was a lot of senseless violence and crime in Starr's neighborhood. As he said; the government needn't look further than that neighborhood to find a real terrorist. The people lived in fear; not only of the police; but of the crime lord in their midst.
The conflict in Starr's family over whether to stay in the neighborhood; despite the danger; or move to a safer neighborhood; also was enlightening. There were a lot of mixed feelings and a sense of betrayal that accompanied her parent's desire to ""better"" their situation and that of their children. It reminded me of that saying about crabs in a bucket; always trying to pull one back in before they can get out. There was certainly plenty of pressure and resentment; both within and outside of her family where this was concerned. They had to balance their desire to improve their situation against the repercussions of being viewed as sell-outs. The same was true for Starr's uncle; who was a police officer.
Overall; this was a wonderful book. I'd definitely recommend it to others; regardless of their views. It provides plenty of food for thought and raises awareness of several important social issues. (less)",48,NEXTBOOK

This book was phenomenal. it completely lived up to the hype.
I have a lot of thoughts on this so here they are (keep in mind this is coming from an Asian American from the Bay Area):
I loved how educational it was. It really made you understand the Black Lives Matter movement and the reality of it. It hit every single point and put you right in the middle of it.
I also liked how Angie Thomas made brought up big points in really subtle ways. For example; â€œFunny how it works with white kids though. Itâ€™s dope to be black until itâ€™s hard to be blackâ€ (11). That is so true. People only like black culture when itâ€™s cool ; but the minute something bad happens to the black community; they distance themselves from it. But the quote that really hit hard was; â€œFunny. Slave masters thought they were making a difference in black peopleâ€™s lives too. Saving them from their â€wild African ways.â€™ Same Shit; different century. I wish people them would stop thinking that people like me need savingâ€ (246). I read that quote and was like; damn; preach it girl!
The minority alliance between Starr and Maya made me so happy. It was so good to see a black girl and her Asian best friend team up. Angie Thomas could have done a bit more with it; but it was still nice to see it included. Personally; I think we need more minority alliances because there is more that unites us than divides us and together we can make a big impact. #Asians4BlackLives
I also liked that this tackled interracial dating. It added an extra layer to the complexity of this novel.
The pop culture references were a really nice and unexpected touch. I was definitely not expecting High School Musical and the Jonas Brothers to be mentioned in this book.
Overall; this book was everything. It should be taught in schools because despite being fiction; it was so informative; thought provoking; and leaves the door open for a lot of discussion. (less)",49,NEXTBOOK

We only hope you got the common sense to
Realize we're unified
And realize we are here to back you
And not let anybody else attack you
So you know we're on your side

The Mighty Mighty Bosstones
The Hate That U Give is an important story about humanity. As much as we think life is ""us against them"" it is really ""us against us"". Across all races there are good and bad people; wise and reckless decisions are made; opinions formulated; etc. But; in the end; there is not much difference between all of us.
This book does a great job of opening the discussion with fairness and open-mindedness. While the setting was inner city in the midst of racial tensions; the book was well written to be accessable to all readers. This is awesome because I think all people should give this story a try. Even if you don't care for YA or worry the subject matter might make you uncomfortable (in which case; you probably need a little uncomfortableness in your life) you should still give it a go.
I listened to the audiobook and the narrator was fantastic. If you tend to prefer audio or are thinking of reading this and wonder which format to try; the audio is definitely worth it. Bahni Turpin gives Angie Thomas' already lively dialogue an extra bump of passion with superb delivery and characterization.
Again; we all live together on this planet and there will not be enough room for us if we continue to let the hate between us grow. This book not only shows what happens if the hate grows; but also what happens when we work together to overcome it. (less)",50,NEXTBOOK

Starr's character was so well written that every time she had to interact with her high school friends I cringed at their responses. This is an incredibly powerful book; not just for its political message but for the internal conflict Starr is struggling with. The story was so much deeper than that initial conflict; it really dug into who Starr is and why she feels guilty even though the reader is screaming at the pages ""You have nothing to feel badly about! You did nothing wrong!""
Though I know there are other authors out there with stories like this to tell; it's so great to see this sort of coming of age story receive the commercial success it has.
I wish Angie Thomas nothing but success and good fortune in all her future endeavors. (less)",51,NEXTBOOK

You can feel prejudiced or discriminated against; but donâ€™t call it racism.
Iâ€™m a biracial person - hi my dadâ€™s familyâ€™s from Vietnam. And as a biracial person I found this book quite hard to read sometimes mostly because of all the comments on interracial relationships. But now again; the way I have to deal with racism isnâ€™t the same way Black people have to deal with it; so obviously the way I react to this book wonâ€™t be the same as Black people do. So yes; I see - but still condemn - why white people - mostly - werenâ€™t happy about some subjects of this book; but then again guys; this book isnâ€™t about you; itâ€™s not about how you feel about the BLM movement; not about how you feel â€insultedâ€™ by a Black man saying he doesnâ€™t trust White people; itâ€™s about what White racist people created throughout the years. YES I felt uncomfortable while reading the comments about interracial relationships in this book but YES I realize it has nothing to do with me - because this book isnâ€™t about my culture - and YES if a Black person tells you youâ€™re being racist you have every right - youâ€™re even encouraged - to shut the hell up because I think they know what racism looks like.
Also; to everybody who says racism isnâ€™t a thing anymore â€¦. how dare you ? How dare you ?! Racism is everywhere; I donâ€™t care if you believe it or not; but it is. Racism is taught to us from kindergarten; when someone makes fun of somebody elseâ€™s accent; of someone elseâ€™s culture; itâ€™s EVERYWHERE so stop saying it doesnâ€™t exist anymore. It does. And people are killed in the name of racism; and they never get the justice they deserve; because YES racism is still a thing; even nowadays in our so called â€advanced societyâ€™. Racism; racism; racism; RACISM. Get used to this word because itâ€™s a reality for a lot of us.
And this book shows exactly what Iâ€™m talking about; and I was mad while reading it because it hurts to see some people are still so blind; and ignorant; and mean.
I also would like to talk about something; because if you donâ€™t know this Iâ€™m French and policemen in my country donâ€™t have guns; so Iâ€™m not all that familiar - and Iâ€™m grateful - with people being killed because theyâ€™re people of colour. But unfortunately weâ€™re familiar with people being beaten up sometimes for NOTHING but the medias will always find something to defend the cops who did something wrong. Every single time. If an innocent man gets punched or worse by a policeman; I donâ€™t give a fuck if he sells drugs or anything else; I just donâ€™t care; but what I care about is that this man is basically being told that itâ€™s his fault if the policeman reacted this way. And in this book people say itâ€™s okay if Khalilâ€™s dead because heâ€™s a drug dealer and he would have died anyway â€¦ but in what world do we live ? People get MURDERED on assumptions and then itâ€™s their fault ? How the fuck does this sound right to you ?
This book is EXTREMELY important. If you think itâ€™s overhyped; then it means there is a problem with you; because this book isnâ€™t. This book is about the truth; the ugly truth. And I liked that itâ€™s explicitly said that all cops arenâ€™t bad cops; all cops arenâ€™t like the one who killed Khalil; because that is important to remember. And the interracial couple was well done. Yes Chris and Starr were cute; but that wasnâ€™t just that. Chris is respectful; he doesnâ€™t try to â€stealâ€™ Starrâ€™s culture; but he does everything to understand her and learn from his mistakes. And so does Starr.
It would be so easy to quit if it was just about me; Khalil; that night; and that cop. It's about way more than that though. It's about Seven. Sekani. Kenya. DeVante.
It's also about Oscar.
Aiyana.
Trayvon.
Rekia.
Michael.
Eric.
Tamir.
John.
Ezell.
Sandra.
Freddie.
Alton.
Philando.
It's even about this little boy in 1955 who nobody recognized at first - Emmett.
The messed-up part ? There are so many more.
Yet I think it'll change one day. How ? I don't know. When ? I definitely don't know. Why ? Because there will always be someone ready to fight. Maybe it's my turn.

""Sometimes you can do everything right and things will still go wrong. The key is to never stop doing right.""
Uff; this book has been a tremendous journey. At first I had a hard time getting used to the peculiar way of speaking and until the end whenever someone said ""A'ight"" (all right) tried to pronounce it and failed.
Itâ€™s a reading that I spent a lot of time because I wanted to understand everything; to live everything. So everytime they mencioned someone; some dance; an artist; I looked for it on the internet and could get more involved in the story; so much that I knew so well all the characters I felt I was with them in the middle of everything.
Starr Carter lives in a troubled neighborhood; where fights and drug traffickers are the order of the day. She and her brothers study at an outside school where the majority are rich and white. She lives between two worlds; not letting herself shows her culture in school and in her neighborhood doesn't act like ""whites"" because they would not approve.
While at a party in her neighborhood a gunfight was set and her childhood friend Khalil offered to take her home. On their way a policeman stops them and in a misunderstanding kills Khalil. She is the only witness.
""Khalil was silenced; but let's join together and make our voices heard for him.""
How can she help Khalil's cause when all she has is her word? This is the story. It is a story that will touch you deeply because of all the repercussions that have on us human beings. The most important: live and have a voice.
A very important thing for me in this reading is to know that the book is inspired by a real movement; Thug life: The hate and give little infants fucks Everybody; proclaimed by Tupac Amaru Shakur; who was a rapper that the lyrics of his songs were focused on growing up around violence; violence against women; neighborhood difficulties and messages of racial equality. What a character and was silenced very soon; being the best example of the subject of this book.
While we wait for the film version; please read this impressive book.

Uff; esta lectura ha sido una tremenda travesÃ­a. Al principio me costÃ³ mucho acostumbrarme a la forma tan peculiar de hablar y hasta el final cada vez que alguien decÃ­a ""A'ight"" (all right) trataba de pronunciarlo y fallaba.
Es una lectura a la que le dediquÃ© mucho tiempo porque querÃ­a entenderlo todo; vivirlo todo. AsÃ­ que cada vez que mencionaban a alguien; algÃºn baile; un artista; lo buscaba en internet y podÃ­a empaparme mÃ¡s en la historia; tanto que al final conocÃ­a tan bien a todos los personajes que sentÃ­a que estaba con ellos en medio de todo.
Starr Carter vive en un vecindario problemÃ¡tico; en donde las peleas y los traficantes de drogas estÃ¡n a la orden del dÃ­a. Ella y sus hermanos estudian en una escuela fuera en donde la mayorÃ­a son ricos y blancos. Ella vive entre dos mundos; no dejando que en el colegio vean su cultura y que en su vecindad no vean cÃ³mo actÃºa frente a los blancos porque no lo aprobarÃ­an.
Estando en una fiesta de su barrio se armÃ³ un tiroteo y su amigo de la infancia Khalil se ofrece a llevarla a su casa. En el camino los para un policÃ­a y en un malentendido mata a Khalil. Ella es la Ãºnica testigo.
Como puede ayudar a la causa de Khalil cuando lo Ãºnico que tiene para hacerlo es su palabra? Esta es la historia. Es una historia que te tocarÃ¡ en lo mÃ¡s profundo por todas las repercusiones que tiene en nosotros los seres humanos. Las mÃ¡s importantes: vivir y tener voz.
Un momento muy importante para mÃ­ en esta lectura es saber que el libro estÃ¡ inspirado en un movimiento real; Thug life: The hate u give little infants fucks Everybody; proclamado por Tupac Amaru Shakur; quien era un rapero que las letras de sus canciones se centraban en crecer alrededor de la violencia; violencia contra las mujeres; dificultades en los barrios y mensajes de igualdad racial. Todo un personaje que fue silenciado muy pronto; siendo el mejor ejemplo del tema de este libro.

Read this.
Not only is this a timely and powerful story; but Angie Thomas has the writing range of a seasoned pro. Starr's voice is refreshing; real; and relatable. This book had some of the most well developed characters that I've ever read. Thomas switches gears from writing a basketball game; to a day working retail; to a family dinner; to a prom scene; to a murder; to rioting in the streets without ever missing a beat. It has such a strong sense of family; friendships; community; and self.

16-year-old Starr Carter's life unravels when she becomes sole witness to the brutal murder of her childhood friend; Khalil Harris. Khalil was an unarmed black boy gunned down by a white police officer.
At its core this is a story we've all heard before. It's a story we're seeing an alarming amount of the time on the news these days. It's a story that is powerful & tragic & relevant.
What I enjoyed most about this book was its honest portrayal of modern issues among black communities; and how largely unaware we who are outside of those communities can be.
There are a lot of hot topic ideas presented here.
~How both drug and prison industries are designed to keep minorities in a revolving door of failure.
~How the media unabashedly contaminates our ideas about reality.
~How the people paid to protect us don't always consider all of us worth protecting.
~How racism is intentional at times. How racism is unintentional at times. How racism is destructive all of the time.
~How death isn't something we think about until it affects someone we know personally.
""Her words used to have power. If she said it was fine; it was fine. But after you've held two people as they took their last breaths; words like that don't mean shit anymore.""
I think this book has all the elements necessary to make a resounding point; a compelling narrative; believable characters; excellent writing; and an insightful voice can all be found here. This is quite an accomplishment for a debut author; especially given the content she chose to tackle.
It addresses those ugly manifestations of hatred; but it also shines a light on the hope we must have for the future.
My own personal fear is that those of us who desperately need to read a story like this will not be the ones racing to pick it up. Nonetheless; it's a story that must be told now and preserved for later.

Yesterday I found out that this book has been banned in a Texas school district (Katy ISD). And honestly??? Iâ€™m so angry right now. Yâ€™all probably donâ€™t know this; but I was born and currently live in Texas (hence my use of the word â€œyâ€™allâ€); so Iâ€™m just extremely!! frustrated!! with the state I call â€œhomeâ€!!!!
The hypothetical reasons for this ban are really; truly; insanely stupid. They say that it might be because of sexual contentâ€•sex was literally mentioned only TWICE in this book!!! And Iâ€™m sure that some books in Katy ISDâ€™s library have more sexual content than this!!! They also say that it might be because of language; and yeah; THUG has a lot of swear words. But again; Iâ€™m sure that there are some books in school libraries with just as much language as THUG; and perhaps even more.
The last reason is just so SO stupid that I can literally feel my face turning red with anger: The book is banned because of its heavy topics of police brutality. Okay; yeah; it makes total sense for a school library to ban a book that is educating people about issues going on in the country they live in!!!
When I read this book; my eyes were opened. Of course I knew that police brutality was happening in America; I just didnâ€™t really grasp its extent. I canâ€™t believe that a school district is banning peopleâ€™s right to read a book so incredibly important in todayâ€™s world; that talks of issues happening RIGHT NOW and need to be addressed. Every student in Katy ISD is being denied this book from their school libraries; when they have every right to be allowed to read it; ESPECIALLY because of the topics that it handles.
A school district should be working towards educating their students in a way that they will grow up to be people who will want to change the world for the better; and banning THUG isnâ€™t going to achieve that. The subjects discussed in this book are so so important; and I honestly cannot believe that someone had the audacity to ban such an influential book. They are smothering the voices of almost 3 million black Texans; 45 million black Americans; all because the topics are [raises voice to a whine] â€œtoo heavyâ€.
Banning a book does not make the truth any less real; nor any less uncomfortable; it only makes you ignorant.
â€œTexas; o Texas; all hail the mighty stateâ€?? No thanks.

ORIGINAL REVIEW-------------------------
4.5 stars.
This is a book that everyone needs to read. No matter what race you are; this is just SUCH an important book; and if thereâ€™s one book that needs to be assigned to all school reading; itâ€™s this one. It has been a New York Times bestseller for MONTHS; and all for good reason.
WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK
â— It has such an important message. The Hate U Give talks about police brutality in America; and how white policemen are shooting innocent; unarmed black men. It offers a view point from Starr Carter; who witnessed her black friend Khalilâ€™s death at the hands of a white police man.
â— It is just so eye-opening. Many people know about this issue. But THUG allows you to perceive the story from a personal viewpoint. It opens your eyes to how some black people are living because of stereotypes and discriminationsâ€”and often; theyâ€™re not the best lives. Starr has a unique perspective; being from a black neighborhood in a white school; and witnessing racism at its worst; and it just is so enlightening to see this.
â— I live in America; and while I knew that incidents like this were happening; I didnâ€™t think it was to this extent. I was clueless and oblivious and blind. So for me to read this book and realize the horrors that are going on in my countryâ€¦ it was shocking. But thatâ€™s just another reason why you HAVE to read this book. Because it truly opens your eyes to how far racism towards black people go in America.
â— It is so true and realistic. I honestly almost cried several times because of how unfair and unjust the discrimination was. I got so so frustrated?? Not with the book; but with the worldâ€”of how something this inhumane and horrifying can happen; and is happening. Iâ€™m not even kidding; it was EXTREME frustration; as in I-want-to-throw-this-book-across-the-room-but-I-wonâ€™t-because-itâ€™s-a-book frustration; and if a book can make you feel deep emotions like that; you know itâ€™s good. (My BR partner also was frustrated many times; so you know itâ€™s not just me!)
â— Itâ€™s writtenâ€¦ beautifully?? I donâ€™t know; I just find Angie Thomasâ€™ writing style so easy to read and honest and raw. Or maybe itâ€™s just Starrâ€™s voice. Whatever it is; the book was just super enjoyable to read; which helped balance out the fact that the topic it was talking about was so HEAVY.
â— The characters are amazing!! Starr is so precious and I just love her. Even tho she wants people to speak up when they witness things like she did; she just canâ€™t find the courage to do it herself. That fear makes her so realistic and relatable and you just root for her the entire book. Her family is JUST as amazing; too. They all have such great relationships with each otherâ€”they may have their rough spots but they love each other (and itâ€™s great to see such good family dynamics in YA).
â— The pacing is A+. Usually I have lots of problems with the pacing of contemporaries; but this was just perfect. Although I do feel like some of the novel could be cut out because it was so long; I understand that this novel was meant to be very character-focused.
â— The ending is just beautiful. Itâ€™s not exactly the (view spoiler)
WHY IT WASNâ€™T A PERFECT BOOK
// Racism is a really touchy subject (and personal to me; as Iâ€™ve experienced it before as a POCâ€”though not as extreme as in this book); and these are all just my opinions!!
â— There was discrimination against white people. This book is trying to promote being kind and supportive of each other; and show how racism isnâ€™t making the world any better. [EDIT] Of course; prejudice and racism are different things; but I personally feel like the book was working to make people aware of black racism and prejudice.
â— Because of that; I found the message contradictory at times. HOWEVER; the prejudice towards the white characters definitely does not take away the importance & significance of the message. This also is something that happens in real life and I get that the author was trying to write the book as realistically as possible. I also realize that when Starr and her friends were making prejudiced jokes about whites; they were just thatâ€”jokes. [END EDIT] It happens all the time in todayâ€™s world; to all races. Even the white people make jokes about the black people in this book. But that still doesnâ€™t make it okay.
â— For me; something was lacking. It was an absolutely amazing read and so so powerful & important; but I just feel like something was off?? I really canâ€™t explain itâ€”I know itâ€™s not only me because my BR partner said something was missing for her too. Thatâ€™s literally the only reason why I knocked off half a star.
This book has such high praise from everyone; and itâ€™s not for nothing. This truly is one of the most powerful YA books Iâ€™ve ever read; and the message it has so inspiring. In a world today where so many people face racismâ€”even if itâ€™s in the form of a â€œjokeâ€â€”this is a book that everyone needs to read. It is SO SO eye-opening and influential. I canâ€™t say it enough; god; just READ THE BOOK.

""I've got a bad feeling;"" he whispered...
""A piece of magic is parading as a god; a poisoned fog is destroying London; and three Antari are sparring aboard our ship. I'd be worried if you didn't.""
The plot hit the ground running and the first 10% was SO intense. But then it kind of slowed down and I lost a bit of enthusiasm/interest until everyone got on a ship. I do love ships. They bring out everyone's cocky pirate side.
So the story picked up a lot about halfway through and the entire last half was amazing! So many feels. I love ALL of these characters so much (but Lila will always be my favorite).
""My name is Lila Bard;"" she answered; drawing her favorite knife; ""and I don't give a damn.""
The best parts were probably just seeing Kell; Lila; Rhy; and Alucard interact more. I liked the little things like how Lila's the first person to treat Rhy like he doesn't need saving. Actually; seeing Rhy grow so much might have been my favorite part of the story. There's also a lot more backstory for Holland; which helped a ton!
I was pretty much split between the following feels in the second half:

Schwab had so much potential going into this series; but ultimately I find myself very let down.
I honestly don't know how to review this book without spoilers and so from this point on there will be unmarked spoilers for the entire series.
***SPOILER ALERT TURN BACK NOW***
I feel as though this final installment was very disjointed.
We've got:
âœ”Perspectives tossed in here and there that ultimately amount to nothing.
âœ”Unnecessary emphasis on characters who haven't mattered at all in the first and second books.
âœ”A plot that takes almost 400 pages to really get going.
âœ”Questions raised without answers given.
âœ”A villain who feels neither scary; nor provides a real reason for his being a villain.
So the story begins right where A Gathering of Shadows leaves off. Lila runs off to save Kell and immediately kills Ojka. What was the purpose of creating this neat character; giving us a glimpse of her background; just to kill her off immediately? It felt rather pointless??
Then we spend the next almost 400 pages listening to Kell brood; Alucard jab at Kell while he broods; Rhy float around from room to room (after he avoids death again); and being incessantly reminded that Lila is a cool chick.
If you guys don't already know; Kell and I don't get along. I don't sympathize with his plight; and I find him unnecessarily mopey in most of his scenes (especially in the second book).
I don't mind Alucard; but I find his character to be a bit static. Even by the end of this book; he doesn't grow into anything new and he doesn't really participate in the action scenes in a meaningful way. His sole existence in this story is to create drama for Kell; Rhy; and Lila.
Rhy; though not one of my favorite characters; undeniably experiences the most growth of the four over the course of the book. He evolves his perspective on being given a second chance at life; and ultimately comes to understand what it means to be king. SO bravo I guess on that front?
Lila... Ugh. I want to like Lila so much but she's basically the same Lila we met on the streets in Grey London all those pages back.
Lila's character on her own doesn't bother me as much as the way the Schwab handles telling us about her. I got weary of reading phrases like ""thief-soft footsteps"" and ""she was a mystery"" used to describe her. Like... I get it. She's interesting & capable. You don't need to keep reminding me.
Outside of these characters; we get chapters devoted to random one-time characters that don't really add up to anything; and we get chapters about King Maxim & Queen Emira & Tieren that don't really add up to anything.
Throwing in perspectives like Nasi; a little girl from White London who admired Ojka; did absolutely nothing for the plot or the world building. This character appears two times; around page 140 and around page 520; but her existence bears no consequence on the story.
Using this character to explain more about Ojka's background could have worked; but since ultimately Ojka didn't end up mattering either it amounted to nothing more than a waste of time.
Adding perspectives like Ned Tuttle & King George IV was so incredibly boring; since once again nothing of consequence happens in Grey London while this plot unfolds.
Writing about Maxim and Emira was too little; too late for me. For the first two books; we've known these two to be side characters. This sudden shift to semi-main character status was jolting.
We only scratched the surfaces of the King's and Queen's lives; and there simply wasn't enough there for me to connect to. I felt completely unattached to them; so their eventual deaths were reduced to plot devices for Rhy's development instead of being meaningful on their own.
After a huge stretch of monotony; the plot finally gets itself going when the crew arrives at the floating black market. Here is where I started to become interested in where the story would go. The Inheritor was an interesting solution even if it's existence felt very tailored for defeating Osaron.
For the last 200 pages I was engaged; but pretty disappointed that the resolution of the plot played out exactly the way it was supposed to. Hell; it played out better than it was supposed to really; seeing as Holland survived to see the plan through to completion.
No twists. No surprises. Our four main characters all survive. The end.
Now I'm left wondering:
What about Kell's past? Sure he decided he was better off not knowing about his true parents; but what about me as the reader? Resolving this question with Kell deciding he doesn't need the information was lazy on part of the author.
What about Lila? Where did she come from? How did an Antari originate in Grey London? How did she lose her eye; and why? No; we are too busy being reassured that Lila is sly and mischievous and special to worry about her past; I suppose.
How did the original tokens get into the different Londons? Can we know a little more history so that these worlds don't all feel like cardboard?
What exactly caused Osaron to manifest into Vitari? Shouldn't we be looking for a solution to this problem since this is the second time it's happened? Maybe a way to eliminate the threat that Black London poses by just existing as a magical black hole that spits out perilous villains every so often?
And that brings me to Osaron himself. He just doesn't scare me.
When I read A Darker Shade of Magic; for the first 100 or so pages I was totally and completely enticed by the threat that Osaron presented. His unwanted presence felt menacing and dangerous in Red London and I was intrigued.
But by A Conjuring of Light; he's still... just possessing people? Sure; they're chanting some creepy shit. Sure; he's killed a couple unimportant side characters.
But... Is that all you got?
Oh; and he creates an obsidian replica of the palace for... posturing? Intimidation?
Once all the citizens of Red London are asleep; he's back to being a temperamental; smoke bitch until he's defeated at the end; which wraps up nicely and neatly and quickly in the last 50 or so pages of the book.
I'm not impressed by Osaron.
All three of these books suffer severely from pacing issues; on both a microcosmic and macrocosmic scale. Each book begins with a slow to medium pace; then concludes in a rapid whirlwind of events which is jarring to say the least.
The series takes place over the course of what; a couple months? Maybe 4? Sometimes this can work; but in this case I don't feel it did.
I wish Lila had been gone for two years instead of two months. It would've made much more sense for her to come back after two years of studying with Alucard to feel confident enough to enter the Essen Tasch.
It would've given all of these characters time to grow into people I cared about.
Now; perhaps you noticed I have been neglecting to mention Holland.
That's because Holland was undoubtedly the star of the show.
Holland's moments were such a treat for me. I was immediately entranced by him; and I drank in every one of his stories that Schwab graced us with.
We get his backstory. We understand his motivations. We glimpse the events that have shaped him; hardened him; softened him. Holland's development causes the others' to pale by comparison.
He possessed a depth I could sink my claws into. His death in the Silver Woods was beautifully tragic; and wonderfully appropriate. I just wanted to wrap him in my arms and die with him.
If this series had been about Holland; I would likely be giving it 5 stars right now.
Aside from Holland; Schwab's writing once again is absolutely stunning. This is an author who always impresses me with her writing style. She is whimsical in her descriptions; unique in how she conveys emotion to her readers. I am truly a fan of reading her words.
But this series just did not deliver for me. I craved more intensity. I needed more unpredictability. I wanted meaningful characters that danced their way into my heart & a rich world that beckoned me to keep turning the pages.
What I found here was a superb concept with a less-than-superb execution. (less)",65,NEXTBOOK

I am so completely overwhelmed with emotions and so far past blown away... and now I'm trying to write a review for one of the greatest stories ever told.
""Love and loss;"" he said; ""are like a ship and the sea. They rise together. The more we love; the more we have to lose. But the only way to avoid loss is to avoid love. And what a sad world that would be.""
You guys... if you haven't picked up this series... start it now. As an aspiring author... I pray to get even a sliver of Schwab or Bardugo's brilliance. The writing was absolute perfection. But really quick.. can we just focus on how freaking awesome Schwab is as a person? I don't know if you've seen her twitter... but she's so open and honest about the struggles of being a writer (not to mention hilarious) but then she pumps out something like this book. Wow. Also; I got to meet her at Yallfest. I was in a wheelchair and I couldn't have gotten back to her signing - but she actually took time to come out to me. Victoria... *virtual hug*
Anyway; since I'm barely able to even function (I'm still a blubbering mess after finishing this book...) I'm just going to summarize a mess of words/statements below and hope it makes sense.
Be ready because the moment you open this book... you'll hit the ground running. It picks up literally seconds where the second left off... and it doesn't slow down. The first 20-30% was non stop craziness... and it was wonderful and painful and entirely too stressful and I found myself screaming and laughing and I don't even know.. you guys... I don't even know.
The only slow moments in this ENTIRE book were the flashbacks - and there were lots of little ones all throughout. They were very core to character development and I actually really enjoyed them.
I literally cannot even begin to talk about the plot. I'm going to refrain from giving away any details. But I'll say this- I really liked the first book though I felt it was slow at times. I LOVED the second as it took the series to a whole new level of emotional turmoil. This one just blew me away. The pacing was perfect (as I said; VERY fast paced; only slowing during flash backs) and full of surprises (and stress). I was so attached to everyone (even the side characters) that I was literally racing through the pages so now I'm going to have to go back and reread for details. I've highlighted about 30 quotes. I've cried and laughed and screamed and now I'm completely exhausted.
""We don't choose what we are; but we choose what we do.""
To summarize; here's what you can expect.
1. Blood. Repeatedly. (Like... half of this book is fight scenes I feel like.)
2. New and interesting POVs.
3. Kiss your heart goodbye.
4. Tears. Lots.
5. Stress and anxiety because you'll love EVERYONE
6. Pirate ships. Magic. New magical abilities.
7. Brilliance. On every page.
So all I have left is to sit here and proclaim my love for the cast.
Lila is her usual BAMF self. She had so many witty one liners and she was endless entertainment. I love love loved her contribution to the story - she kinda has a character arc but kinda doesn't. She's learned to let people in; but at the same time; she's so true to herself. Some of the highlights for me were obviously moments with Kell- but also with Alucard. (Ok; brb; need to cry because of all the emotional beautifulness.)
Kell. I literally cannot. Precious smol- must be protected at all costs. This guy. The second book made me feel for him SO much. He's so selfless that even Rhy gives him crap about being so perfect. Oh my gosh Kell and Rhy- strongest brother relationship I've ever read. I need to cry again. Also Kell and Alucard banter was EVERYTHING. And then the parental issues... you'll just have to see.
Rhy - easily one of my all time favorite characters. He' so freaking hilarious and sassy and I feel like we would be best friends. He's easily as selfless as Kell; though he doesn't even see it. A little reckless; but he can't help it.
HOLLAND. Holy freaking crap of the world. I did not expect to care about him so much. I can't even function right now. BYE.
Alucard. I can't form words. BYE.
Ugh. The whole entire cast. Even the side characters like Lenos and Hostra .. and oh my gosh the whole Maresh family... I'm just... I want to cry because every character was so beautifully done.
The ending does not disappoint. Everything was wrapped up - and I'm just sitting here thinking... what now? What do I even do with myself? Do I pick it up and read it again? Do I sit here and grieve because its over? Ugh.
Lastly; I HIGHLY recommend the audiobook version!! The second book and this book are narrated by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading and they are both wonderful - but especially Kate Reading for Delilah. Seriously I was LOLing so much at her sarcastic wit.
You guys... read this series.
OH OH is this a Leigh Bardugo / Six of Crows reference? Ahahah.

â€œAnoshe brought solace. And hope. And the strength to let go.â€
No need for Anoshe; I donâ€™t need any additional strength to let go of this series. Let it be known here that I wonâ€™t be reading any more books written by VE Schwab. This is where I must part way with her works. Trust me itâ€™s better for me to do this. For her fans; Iâ€™m happy that you love her series but you donâ€™t want to see me rant and rated her books with bad reviews right? I have read all her (Not under Victoria Schwab) book; including the novella â€Warm Upâ€™ and her books just degrade in quality with each new release for me.
'Vicious' being the first and the best one I read from her; it was a one hit wonder and believe me I wouldâ€™ve continue with the series but the problem is; after reading this trilogy I change my mind. Vicious shouldâ€™ve ended up as a standalone; it ended perfectly and I hate when authors decided to continue a standalone into a trilogy. Just like ADSOM (A Darker Shade of Mediocre); the first book started and ended well as a standalone and it shouldâ€™ve stayed that way.
To sum up; my experience reading this straight after AGOS (A Gathering of Shit); itâ€™s like wiping my ass with sandpaper instead of a tissue. In other word; a bloody asshole experience.
The plot continued straight after the previous book and I seriously thought this book wouldâ€™ve been better cause it took you into the heat of the action and story right from the beginning but no; as soon as it landed on the 200 pages mark; it became so much worse. To explain this without spoiling anything; this series contained so many plot holes that a Diglett could make a living out of this series.
For example; itâ€™s been stated from the first book that Kell lost his memory before heâ€™s adopted into the Maresh family; just when I thought the book was going to tell his story; nope; the book said â€œfuck you; youâ€™re not getting oneâ€ and instead; letting me know that Lila is a damned one of a kind. Apparently mentioning her Mary Sue existence repeatedly is more important than the characters background.
Iâ€™ll be honest; this book is less infuriating to read compared to AGOS because thereâ€™s less emphasis on Lila compared to before but my god this series is the first series that ever made me pray to a fictional character. I kept on praying to Kira Yagami; â€œKira; please write Lilaâ€™s name. Cause of death: impaled by her own knifes through her mouth.â€ to end her life every moment she spoke.
â€œThen why are you smiling?â€ â€œBecause;â€ she said; â€œbad ideas are my favorite kind.â€
OH REALLY!? How about this? Take out your favorite knifes; cut your tongue out or drown yourself in the Arnesian sea. How bowdah for a bad idea? Seems like something you'd enjoy; hmm? Hmm? HMMM!?
Apparently being reminded that sheâ€™s a badass (pretty sure she literally has a bad ass now) is more crucial to the explanation behind her ultimate Mary Sue developments; there is no clear explanation behind all her powers; her background; NONE! But get this; instead of Kellâ€™s and Lilaâ€™s background; VE Schwab decided to let us know about so many side characters that barely made an appearance in the previous books. Why in the world would I care about these side characters that barely exist from before when I couldnâ€™t even care about the main characters already? Use these pages to flesh out the background of the main characters dammit; not providing POV for so many characters that are worthless to the main story.
Like the previous book; most of the story took place only in Red London. Seriously; the amount of wasted potential on the world-building of this series too damn huge. In fact; only the first book of the trilogy applied the 4 London concepts appropriately.
The main antagonist is also one of the worst antagonists I ever read in a fantasy or any book. Not only heâ€™s like a ghost whoâ€™s less scary than Casper; Michelin wouldâ€™ve made a scarier antagonist compared to this fart; no seriously; look at this beast.
The final confrontation is very underwhelming; to say the least. It took more than 500 pages to reach and it ended in less than 40 pages. Instead of a great climax scene; we receive a tedious 50 pages epilogue with cheesy romance.
Honestly; this book shouldâ€™ve received a one star from me but again; I have huge praises towards Holland. This is literally the only redeeming factor of the book for me; unlike all other character; this book actually sheds light on Hollandâ€™s background beautifully. Right from his childhood up to why heâ€™s the way he is now. In my opinion; Holland shouldâ€™ve been the main character of the trilogy. IF every other character received the same treatment as him; this book wouldâ€™ve been a much better experience. Instead all we get is brooding Kell; Mary Sue who have a fetish with knives and other worthless POV's less important than potatoes.
One last thing to mention; Rhyâ€™s development is not bad here; in the first book he seemed like this creature that will literally fuck everything that moves; despite his stupidity in some part of the book; he actually has more personality and development compared to the Kell and Lila.
I could go on for so much longer on why this book didnâ€™t work for me but Iâ€™ll just end it here. This series drained the energy out of me and now Iâ€™m literally exhausted. I seriously thought VE Schwab probably signed a contract with the devil or something during my time of reading this book to make this book reached its fame and praises with this quality. Donâ€™t believe me? Look at the total number of pages of the UK edition; itâ€™s 666.
Shade of Magic is easily the worst trilogy I ever read in my entire life so far. It will be hard for me to ever find another series as bad as this. I know Iâ€™m on the unpopular opinion side on this trilogy here but I honestly wonâ€™t recommend this trilogy for anyone whoâ€™s an avid adult fantasy fans. I feel robbed buying the physical books and thinking this will be an adult-oriented trilogy which it definitely isnâ€™t. This is an unpopular and honest opinion of mine; Iâ€™m glad that a lot of you love this series but sadly; itâ€™s just not for me.

HI. I mean; how do I even review this. I don't think I really will?? I don't want to give spoilers. I just want to say (a) VE Schwab is a writing queen and wonder; (b) this is exactly what a series conclusion should be like; (c) i hurt man i hurt so bad in the best possible way; and (d) it was perfecccccccccccccctttttttt.
SMALL LIST OF THINGS I LOVE
â€¢ Kell's coat. I'm not saying this lightly; it is literally my favourite character
â€¢ KELL'S COATTTTTT
â€¢ the romance was like A++++ and didn't overpower but yet was excellent
â€¢ my ships <3
â€¢ I mean I ship myself with Kell's coat tbh but let's not talk about that
â€¢ magical objects. magical objects everywhere
â€¢ the light of my life is Kell and Alcurd bickering because they are old cranky women who don't like to share Rhy apparently
â€¢ Lila showing love by stabbing people
â€¢ sass in times of strife
â€¢ black magic; black magic everywhere
â€¢ the way the book can hurt so fiercely by damaging/taking away things the characters love so their pain is your pain and it's 10000 x worse than anything
â€¢ Holland who is a precious cinnamon muffin and should not suffer so
â€¢ literally me right now to Holland = <3 <3 <3 <3
â€¢ everything
â€¢ i loved everything let's just get it out there
SPOILERS ABOUT THE ENDING:
(view spoiler)
BASICALLY THERE IS SO MUCH STABBING AND BLOOD AND MAGIC AND IT IS 100% EVERYTHING I LOVE IN A BOOK. This is my all time favourite series omg (apart from The Raven Cycle) and it's perfect and HURTS and I've never loved characters quite as much as I love Kell and Rhy. <3 <3 <3
Also FYI: my hardcover preorder arrived damaged so if that's not a metaphor I don't know what is.
""You think this is a bad idea?""
""Without a doubt.""
""Then why are you smiling?""
""Because;"" she said; ""bad ideas are my favourite kind.""
""So Osaron is just a piece of magic with an ego?"" asked Rhy.
Kell's gaze shifted to the bed; sheets rumpled where Alucurd had been lying moments before. ""Taking your task seriously; I see.""
""Quite.""
""I told you to keep him safe; not cuddle.""
Alucard spread his hands behind him on the sheets. ""I'm more than capable of multitasking.""
""What have you done?"" demanded Kell.
""It was just a tonic; sir;"" he fumbled; ""something for sleep.""
""You drugged her?""
""It was Tieren's order;"" said Hastra; chastised. ""He said she was mad and stubborn and no use to us dead."" Hastra lowered his voice when he said this; mimciking Tieren's tone with startling accuracy.
""And what do you plan to do when she wakes back up?""
Hastra shranks back. ""Apologise?""
Kell made an exasperated sound as Lila nuzzled -- actually nuzzled -- his shoulder.
""I suggest;"" he snapped at the young man; ""you think of something better. Like an escape route.""

This was an intense read; and I LOVED every moment of it (even when I was crying and in pain). A magnificent book and conclusion to a series. These characters have stolen my heart and run off with it. I don't mind; though.

You would not be wrong in thinking of me as a girl of few certainties.
â€œ...They do not spring forth whole into the world.â€
The usual ones: the love of my family; my love for them; and one big dream -we all have one of those; even when we don't know we do- that keeps me going.
â€œ...They form slowly; rolled between the hands of time until their edges smooth...â€
There are also one or two things peculiar to me alone; of course. Unfortunately; they have a tendency to be dull things. But one of these; the brightest one; I think; is that I love stories. Always have; always will.
â€œ...until the saying of the story gives enough weight to the wordsâ€”to the memoriesâ€”to keep them rolling on their own.â€
And once; I used to think I knew how stories work. I thought I was able to pick them up; look them over; and tell who and what and where and when. (Though not the why; the why is always another story.)
â€œ...But all stories start somewhere...â€
I thought indeed that I could say; here it starts; and; there it ends. But as I grew; and read; I started to see that things are not quite this simple. It would take a certain story to finally make realize the truth. The truth being...
â€œ...and that night; as Rhy Maresh walked through the streets of London...â€
The truth being; stories don't like to have their boundaries set. Never have.
â€œ...a new myth was taking shape.â€
And never will.
â€¢One day I'll publish an essay on what makes for a good storytelling; and all I will write in it will be: Victoria Schwab nailed it all down. There is no other way to put it: in A Conjuring of Light; and in the Shades of Magic series more generally; she was perfect. Elegant; graceful; confident; composed while vibrant and stirring while unruffled; polished; dynamic; exquisite; in two words; absolutely regal. Schwab's prose is something you can't equal; because it's one of a kind; something you can't forget; because it won't let you go; and something you can't even believe; because it is; very simply; too beautiful and mesmerizing to be true.
â€¢Each one of these characters is so fleshed-out I'm honestly astonished that even their names can stay put and flat on the page. In the previous instalment; I'd had some issues with Lila; who in my eyes had gone through the whole book being more boastful and hot-headed than I -or anyone- could take; instead of showing the determination and strength that had captivated me in A Darker Shade of Magic. But the Lila we meet in this conclusion is definitely more mature; while losing none of her distinctive fierceness and boldness and tenacity.
â€œThere were a hundred shades between a truth and lie; and she knew them all.â€
â€¢Kell; Rhy and Alucard are just as amazing as we all knew they would be; plus; prepare yourselves to be delighted -and wrecked; and shattered; and wrecked some more- by some secrets concerning Alucard's (and to a degree Rhy's) past and some crucial plot-twists determining our favourite crown prince's future. The events test them both; and they are made all the stronger by their obstacles; the ones they share as well as the ones they have to overcome alone. Rhy's dedication and resolve; in particular; are splendidly inspirational.
â€¢It seems my stupid; stupid mind realized this only with this book; but Holland is such an incredible and extraordinary character. I cannot explain how much my heart bled and sang for him. I feel the need to reread the whole series just to appreciate him as he deserves and as I should have done from the beginning.
â€œCaring was a thing with claws. It sank them in; and didnâ€™t let go. Caring hurt more than a knife to the leg; more than a few broken ribs; more than anything that bled or broke and healed again. Caring didnâ€™t break you clean. It was a bone that didnâ€™t set; a cut that wouldnâ€™t close.â€
â€¢Osaron is one of the best villain I've had the (dis)pleasure to meet in a long while; and I was completely caught off guard and captivated by how compelling he proved to be. Besides; I utterly adore the concept that he's pure magic.
â€œIt is an arrogant man that thinks himself a god.
And an arrogant god; thought Tieren; looking to the window; that thinks himself a man.â€
â€¢The plots of A Darker Shade of Magic and A Gathering of Shadows were already exceptional; but A Conjuring of Light basically towers over them. Fast-paced and heart-stopping; yet it never comes off as overly packed or in any way excessive -since we've already established that Schwab's trademarks are elegance and balance; I shouldn't even need to specify it.
â€¢There is one single insignificant tiny thing that felt slightly random; or maybe out of place; and that's the favour that Lila traded with (view spoiler). I expected it to be brought up again before the end; and it wasn't; and it felt a bit like a loose end. I'm really trying not to hope that Schwab purposely made it so; so as to have a sort of foothold for a possible continuation/spin-off/something; I promise I'm trying; but it just seems so natural and obvious once you notice. I just don't want my heart broken (again).
Speaking of loose ends; I also thought Nasi's POV had been introduced because she would have a role later in the story; but that was apparently a red herring or purely a necessity in order to develop Ojka's character.
â€¢I think that plot-wise this works perfectly; and I feel that this was exactly how things were supposed to go; but I was and still am dreadfully curious about (view spoiler). I guess that's just something I'll have to live with. (See how hard I'm trying not to hope?)
âž½ I could try to put into words what I feel for this series; I could put my thinking cap on and make countless attempts; and still I would get nowhere. There simply are no words. I can only redirect you to my review of A Darker Shade of Magic and my review of A Gathering of Shadows; and hope they'll make my point a little clearer. Because believe me; you want to pick this series up. Of course; afterwards you'll want to kill me for introducing you to the most addictive obsession (?) of your life. But I'm more than confident that you'll also want to thank me. And until then; anoshe. (less)",71,NEXTBOOK

i loved that this picked up immediately where â€a gathering of shadowsâ€™ left off. it was such a quick dive straight into the conclusion and this final book really has the best qualities of the previous two - more marvellous world building is at play as the characters travel beyond the city of london; and touching backstories/flashbacks are present to give even more depth and development to those characters with whom i have bonded. but where this book found its own voice was in its plot.
this was filled with so much more action and adventure that wasnt quite as prevalent previously. so much was at stake that i couldnt put this down - i became so invested in the captivating writing; the constant peril and intrigue; and the emotions i felt for the characters and their redemption. just everything about this pulled me in and wouldnt let go.
and even though this book hit every mark all the way through; it was really the ending that shined for me. this was wrapped up so nicely and provided the closure i needed after pouring my heart and soul into this story across three books. i felt very at peace with the way the story was resolved; which is all i could have asked for.
and so to this series i tenderly and lovingly say; anoshe - until another day.

Victoria Schwab is my favourite. I've read every one of her books; from The Archived to The Near Witch; This Savage Song and Vicious. Alright; not the middle grade/childrens books; but I feel like I'm a little too old for that.
I love her. She is one amazing; badass author. She has such a beautiful mind; she writes the most fantastic; dark and thrilling stories. She is truly unique and I'm so excited what the future holds for her (and for her readers).
It may not come as a surprise when I tell you that the Shades of Magic series is one of my favourites as well. The concept alone is stunning. ADSOM swept me off my feet. In AGOS I lost my heart to Rhy and Alucard (I lost it to Rhy in ADSOM already; but a heart can be lost more then once when it's Rhy).
I had the highest of hopes for this finale. Maybe slightly too high. I think I scared myself a little. And while I loved the book it didn't take me by storm. I think it's one of those ""It isn't you; it's me!"" cases because I can't find anything wrong with this book. I'm just not in love with it the way I'm in love with book 1 and 2.
Writing a conclusion to a series is hard. It happens so (so so so) often that I'm 100% thrilled by a series and then 100% disappointed with the last book. Only a few authors manage to make the finale as great or even better than the prequels. Two rare examples are J.K. Rowling and Nora Sakavic. Even Leigh Bardugo and Maggie Stiefvater can't always convince me and they are two incredible writers.
So what happened here? Why was I hesitating to pick this book up; when I was desperately pining for it for a whole year? What was I scared of? Yup; you guessed it: Disappointment.
In the end the pacing was great; but some plot twists felt superfluous; unnecessary. Red London is in a state of panic and destruction. Osaron is the most powerful evil black magician ever. There is no time for anything but battle preparation. And the three most powerful magicians; the three people who are truly capable of destroying Osaron leave the country for several days? I'm not sure that's very realistic. There were several situations like this; some where I thought that they could have been left out of the book entirely and nothing would have changed except for the page count. In the end; a smaller page count and a more crafted and comprimised plot would have improved the book and left me more satisfied.
This fantasy world also lost some of it's magic. Book 1 was so special and creative; book 2 introduced us to new cultures and characters; but book 3 didn't have this original and simply magical feeling to it anymore. Something went missing along the way. Even my favourite ship (Rhylucard) was less exciting than before.
Luckily Victoria's writing is on point. Here dialouges are simply really good and so is the world she created. I'm also glad that Lila finally got a grip and got off this ego trip that she was on in AGOS. She annoyed me to hell and back.
I couldn't give this book 5 stars even if I wanted to and 3 stars would have been the understatement of the year; but 4 stars feel just right.
Victoria Schwab deserves a break. She is writing books like a madwoman and her books are intense and nervewracking and probably a hard pierce of work for the author. And while I can't wait for Vengeful and Our Dark Duet I just want to say thank you so much for the wonderful stories you share with us. You are truly awesome.

I was so afraid to go into it because I just knew everyone was going to die and that would be it; THEN END! Yes; people died. Yes; I let out some tears at parts. Yes; it was amaze balls. Yes; there was a lot of blood and violence. Yes; there was evil and magic and good. YES! YES! YES!
I love Rhy; Kell; Lila and Alucard so much. I even started to love ole Holland. There are other side people too. â¤
There is so much stuff going on. It starts right out of the gate and just doesn't really stop. Maybe a break here and there but not too much. I think this was a perfect ending to this trilogy.
And I love that Lila is a bad@ssed woman in the book! I love when author's add a woman that can kick arse and take names.
""Tell you what; "" said the first attacker. ""If you beg; we'll make it quick.""
Lila's blood sang the way it always did before a fight; clear and bright and hungry. ""And why;"" she said; ""would I want to rush your deaths?""
""Cocky bitch;"" growled the second. ""I'm gonna fu--""
Her knife hissed through the air and embedded itself in his throat. Blood spilled down his front as he clawed at his neck and toppled forward; and she made it under the next man's guard before the body hit the ground; driving her serrated blade up through his chin before the first blow caught her; a fist to the jaw.
She went down hard; spitting blood into the street.
Heat coursed through her limbs as a hand grabbed her by the hair and hauled her to her feed; a knife under her chin.
""Any last words?"" asked the man with the rotting teeth.
Lila held up her hands; as if in surrender; before flashing a vicious smile.
""Tyger; Tyger;"" she said; and the fire roared to life.
If you haven't read this trilogy and have been wanting to; I suggest you get on it because it's freaking awesome!

#3 A Conjuring of Light â…â…â…â…â…
Iâ€™ve been putting off writing this review for a month; which is about the same length of time I put off finishing the book itself; because I simply have not been prepared to say goodbye to this trilogy. Reading these three books has been one of the most emotional; anxiety-inducing; and genuinely magical experiences of my entire life. I have so much to say; with no idea how to express any of it.
â€œLove and loss;â€ he said; â€œare like a ship and the sea. They rise together. The more we love; the more we have to lose. But the only way to avoid loss is to avoid love. And what a sad world that would be.â€
I can safely say that I have never loved every character in a series the way I do with this one. I mourned every loss; laughed and cried tears of joy over each close call; every triumph; every kiss and reunion. The thing about this trilogy is that there are certain evils which must be faced and conquered; but what really stays with you is the build-up of these characters and their relationships with one another. I canâ€™t even choose a favorite; because I love them all so much; in such different ways.
â€œScars are not shameful; not unless you let them be. If you do not wear them; they will wear you.â€
In typical Schwab fashion; though; the action scenes are downright glorious. I love that; no matter how many moving pieces are in a battle; I never struggle to keep up with exactly what is happening; because her writing is so immersive that it transports you right into the center of the fight. You never know quite what twist or slight of hand to expect next.
â€œWhat are we drinking to?â€
â€œThe living;â€ said Rhy.
â€œThe dead;â€ said Alucard and Lila at the same time.
â€œWeâ€™re being thorough;â€ added Rhy.
Of course; itâ€™s not all war and heartache; there are always these gorgeous moments woven in of bonding; of bickering and playful banter. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever laughed so much in so many moments of sheer and utter anxiety; but thatâ€™s this series in a nutshellâ€”especially the second and third installments. I actually joked recently that Iâ€™m so happy there is going to be a spin-off series; but at the same time; I need ample room to recover before putting my heart through the misery of another book with these characters scaring me half to death and breaking my heart every other chapter.
â€œDeath comes for us all. I would simply have mine mean something.â€
I donâ€™t know what else to say at this point. I wanted this review to be eloquent and thorough; but when I think back on this story; I am immediately pulled into such reminiscence for the feelings it drew out of me that I have a hard time viewing it subjectively and squaring it off into little; easy to describe compartments.
â€œAnoshe was a word for strangers in the street; and lovers between meetings; for parents and children; friends and family. It softened the blow of leaving. Eased the strain of parting. A careful nod to the certainty of today; the mystery of tomorrow. When a friend left; with little chance of seeing home; they said anoshe. When a loved one was dying; they said anoshe. When corpses were burned; bodies given back to the earth and souls to the stream; those left grieving said anoshe.
Anoshe brought solace. And hope. And the strength to let go.â€
A month after completing it; I feel comfortable in now saying that this is the single greatest series I have ever read in my life; and Victoria Schwab has solidified a permanent place in my heart. I will buy anything and everything she writes in the future; and I will doubtlessly reread this trilogy over and over again. The writing is so flawless; and frankly; you could just tattoo this whole damn trilogy onto my body if there was enough room; and Iâ€™d be just fine with that; thank you.

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD
Delilah Bard:
He said she was mad and stubborn and no use to us dead - an accurate summary of lila bard by tieren; head priest and knower of things
â€œYou think this is a bad idea;â€ he said. It wasnâ€™t a question. But it sparked something in Lila; rekindled the fire in her eyes and ignited a grin.
â€œWithout a doubt.â€
â€œThen why are you smiling?â€
â€œBecause;â€ she said; â€œbad ideas are my favorite kind.â€
Itâ€™s no secret (if you know me at all) that I identify as Lila Trashâ„¢; and @allthehaters; here's a list of reasons why LILA BARD IS AWESOME AND YOU'RE WRONG:
1. SHE SINGLE HANDEDLY RESCUED KELL FROM A PARALLEL UNIVERSE FROM A CAGE PROTECTED BY THE SHARPEST KNIGHT IN WHITE LONDON
2. She's fucking badass.
3. She's Lila Bard and she doesn't give a damn.
My friend (who hated Lila) said she wasn't as annoying in this book. And I suppose; in a sense it's true - she went through a hell lot of character development. She hated goodbyes; but she said them. She hated caring; but she cared anyway. She wanted to run; but she stayed anyway. These subtle changes were far more powerful than any words could be.
If book #1 was Kell and book #2 was Lila; this was Holland. Holland; who V.E. Schwab ships with sadness. Holland; who lost everything but still fought for his world. Holland; who broke my heart because FUCK NOBODY DESERVES SO MUCH PAIN.
The bodies piled. Athos watched. Astrid grinned. Hollandâ€™s hand moved on its puppet string. And his mind screamed until it finally lost its voice.
- Kell x Lila: They kiss so much?? Honestly I should have kept count of how many times they kiss because theyâ€™re rushing off to danger every two seconds and just kiss before all the time just for luck you know
- also LILA ALMOST DIED and kell breaks apart and jfc he carries her back and hugs her and MY HEART
- Rhylucard: I SHIP THEM SO MUCH. SO DAMN MUCH.
- I swear; 75% of my highlights from this book are rhylucard moments because they're so precious honestly
â€œLuc?â€ rasped Rhy.
â€œIâ€™m here;â€ answered Alucard. â€œIâ€™m here. Stay with me.â€
He tried to speak; but his heart slammed against his ribs as if trying to break through.
It redoubled; then faltered.
- He woke up and called him luc my heart is over he was dying and what he thought of what said was luc jfc
Alucard clutched his loverâ€™s hand.
- HE CALLED HIM HIS LOVER I AM DEAD I AM DYING
- THE WORLD WENT TO HELL AND YOU KNOW WHAT ALUCARDâ€™S REACTION WAS:
All that mattered - all that would ever matter - was this.
Rhy was alive.
- I mean; how can you not cry reading that?
Also can we talk about Kell on Rhylucard & Alucard walking in on Kell and Lila because it's the best thing ever:
- I love Protective Kellâ„¢ so much
â€œI told you to keep him safe; not cuddleâ€
- also this:
â€œKell;â€ she said; the word something between a whisper and a gasp.
And then the door burst open.
Alucard stood in the doorway; soaking wet; as if heâ€™d just been dumped in the sea; or the sea had been dumbed over him.
â€œStop fucking with the ship.â€
- I have never laughed so much in my life
This book is a monster. Actually - V.E. Schwab is a monster. A beautiful cold hearted monster who will stop at nothing less than my death. Well? There you have it. A GODAMM PERFECT ENDING.
This is why I run. Because caring was a thing with claws. It sank them in; and didnâ€™t let go. Caring hurt more than a knife to the leg; motor then anything that bled or broke and healed again. Caring didnâ€™t break you clean. It was a bone that didnâ€™t set; a cut that wouldnâ€™t close.
VERDICT: VICTORIA SCHWAB HAS SHATTERED ME AND I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL EVER BE FINE. WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT EVERYBODY ON THIS PLANET NEEDS THIS TRILOGY IN THERE LIFE.
pre-review(s) because I'm trash lmao
update: IT'S HERE OH MY GOD I'M SCARED TO ACTUALLY READ IT WTF
another update because I CAN'T CONTAIN MY EXCITEMENT WHAT IS THIS LIFE I NEED THIS BUT I CAN'T READ IT will probably skip school and read it the second it comes out because yes I'm Trash honestly I've never wanted anything in my life so much??
ALSO I HEARD THERE'S DEATH I WILL SUE IF THERE'S DEATH
(messages from me to may and honestly i'm mad because nobody's as excited for this as I am HELLO IT'LL BE THE END OF AN ERA) (also i feel like it's been a lot of time since I said this but I LOVE LILA BARD just an update)
Do you know what I just realised? (yes this is an update because I thought I was ready; guess what I'M NOT)

Disclaimer: It's not the book; it might just be me!
Here is the thing; i thoroughly enjoyed Darker Shades of Magic and Gathering of Shadows! However; having to wait an entire year has ruined this series for me. I no longer care about the plot or give any shits about what happens to these characters. I've simply moved on; it seems. This is precisely why i loath starting unfinished series. I am sure it's not a bad book but since i didn't like however much i read; i can't rate it any higher.
(based on what i read)
There is no character development whatsoever.
AH; it bothers me so much. (except Holland)
Lila; let's talk about her first. What is the matter with her? I didn't mind her recklessness in the first book; quite enjoyed it actually. In the second book; however; it was getting a little too ridiculous. i also saw others complaining about it as well; i still decided to overlook it. STUPID ME! This one was just way over the top! This has got to stop. It was just annoying and unrealistic. I couldn't read this bullshit any longer let alone actually take it seriously.
Kell. My precious baby Kell. Oh; how i loved you for years; Kell! You people probably don't have any idea how much I appreciated a character like Kell; who isn't a cliched alpha male crap. (that seems to be the most recent trend in YA *rolls eyes*) His loneliness; him wanting to just belong somewhere got me; man! He seemed totally out of character in this last book. He was whiny and boring AF. Not a great combination; I must say.
I can't stand them as a couple!! They didn't have to be romanticly involved. It felt forced. I've always had an extremely hard time imagining Lila being in a relationship with anyone. IT'S MANON BLACKBEAK ALL OVER AGAIN!!! I'm disgusted and disappointed.
Then there are Rhy and Alucard; who i absolutely; 100% do not give a shit about.
I wanted to keep reading this for Holland.. maybe one day I'll finish it. Just for him. (less)",78,NEXTBOOK

I finished this one a while back; but I just couldn't decide how I felt about it.
I mean; it was ok. Nothing was horribly wrong; and I certainly didn't feel pissed off when I closed the book. It just left me with this vaguely meh feeling.
Like...why did I read all of this?
This was; at 624 pages; a HUGE book. <--for me!
I know some of you read massive tomes every night before bed; but I usually snack on comic books or fluffy romance novels; so when these bigguns don't deliver I feel a tad disappointed.
And I'm not actually saying it didn't deliver; because look at all the bjillion 5 star reviews! Apparently; I'm one of the few people on the planet that had a lukewarm reaction to A Conjuring of Light; so please don't take this review as a slam on the book. It's a solid finish to the trilogy; there are no dangling threads left out there; and I was (for the most part) satisfied by the way it wrapped up.
Schwab is a fantastic storyteller; and since she's managed to write my oldest son's favorite story ever --> Vicious; I'm afraid if I say anything less than glowing I'll have to sleep with one eye open.
You never know with kids these days...
*ducks*
Still; I did have a few issues. I'll tag the ones that are possible spoilers...
(view spoiler)
I guess the other thing I wasn't crazy about was Lila and Kell's relationship. It never felt genuine or even really romantic. I don't know why; but they just seemed like a very dull couple. And I think Schwab can write depth to her romantic attachments because Rhy and Alucard had depth.
P.S. This has nothing to do with the story; but I could not for the life of me stop thinking: Alucard is Dracula spelled backward!
My kids used to LOVE The Batman vs. Dracula movie and there was this one scene in it that kept running through my mind during this entire book...
Dun; dun; duuun! *gasp!*
Anyway.
I guess the rest of it was fine. There was some great stand out moments that I really enjoyed; and I think anyone who has read the first 2 books should be satisfied with this last installment. Overall though; I can't say I this would be a series/trilogy that I'd want to reread. (less)",79,NEXTBOOK

Almost too much if that's possible.
I definitely enjoyed it (and recommend it!) but it wasn't as good as the two other ones in my opinion. I overall liked how things were wrapped up at the end but I felt like Lila's character was a bit one-dimensional.

â€œLove and loss;â€ he said; â€œare like a ship and the sea. They rise together. The more we love; the more we have to lose. But the only way to avoid loss is to avoid love. And what a sad world that would be.â€
I have read one book in this series every year for the BooktubeSFF Awards. And every year I enjoy what Iâ€™m reading; I close the book pretty pleased; and then I sit down to write my review and start thinking about how these are such big books with so little happening. And I know they are character driven. One of my favorite books of all time is the most character driven thing out there; but for some reason I just donâ€™t love this series like everyone else does.
A Conjuring of Light is the third and final novel in this trilogy that surround four different parallel Londons:
âž½ Grey London - is like our real world's London; with no magic. Delilah Bard is from this London.
âž½ Red London - is the home of the main protagonist; Kell; where he and his royal family rule. There is an abundance of magic in this London; most coming from a red river which lights up the whole city.
âž½ White London - is a city in war with itself. It was ruled by evil twins; but now has a new king. Everyone in this London tries to fight for magic and power within this corrupt city.
âž½ Black London - and is still basically a mystery. It is essentially a lost city; since regular people cannot travel between worlds.
And after the brutal cliffhanger ending that was A Gathering of Shadows; A Conjuring of Light picks right back up after the events! And without saying anything too spoilery; since this is the concluding novel and all; our main character; Kell Maresh; and his home; Red London; are in serious danger. But with the help of a ruthless thief/assassin; Lila Bard; a swoon-worthy pirate; Alucard Emery; the best prince to have ever lived; Rhy Maresh; and a very morally grey Antari; Holland Vosijk; they are trying to save everything theyâ€™ve ever known and loved.
â€œLife isn't made of choices; it's made of trades. Some are good; some are bad; but they all have a cost.â€
And even the idea of four different color coded Londons; with a handful of magical people who can travel between them; is so damn genius that I donâ€™t even have words for it. Also; V.E. Schwab is such a talented writer. The way she echoes phrases from different books; or even sentences from previous chapters; is so powerful and is able to evoke all the emotions from me. She truly can weave and craft paragraphs together so expertly and Iâ€™m constantly impressed with her writing.
I just feel like not a lot happens in her books. Like; a few big; key; important things happen without question; and storylines get completed; but I just feel like it is such a longwinded journey to get there. And these books are so easily consumable that you donâ€™t really realize until after youâ€™ve closed the book. I mean; at least for me and my personal reading experiences. Seriously; go back and look at my other two reviews; I say the same thing. Also; the big bad villain just fell so very short for me. The magic started off so dang well; but the villain really ended up feeling lackluster to me.
But my biggest complaint about the other two installments in this series is that they donâ€™t read or feel adult to me. But you know what A Conjuring of Light reads and feels like? Adult; without question. Also; just a little caveat; if an author says their work is in a certain age bracket/genre; then it is. I am just saying A Darker Shade of Magic and A Gathering of Shadows donâ€™t feel or read like adult fantasy to me; but Iâ€™m not saying they arenâ€™t. But ACOL did give me those brutal moments that made me go â€œokay; this isnâ€™t YAâ€ quite a lot.
Also; trigger and content warnings for abuse; torture; abduction; slavery; captivity; talk of suicide; violence; gore; heavy blood depiction; abandonment; and depiction of grief and PTSD. Oh and I guess sexual content; too; but nothing too graphic. (Also; hello; perverted Melanie here to report that that sex scene was 11/10 and was so smooth and sexy and I actually loved it!)
â€œI have never known what to make of you. Not since the day we met. And it terrifies me. You terrify me. And the idea of you walking away again; vanishing from my life; that terrifies me most of all.â€
But my biggest love for this series is Rhy Maresh; who has completely and without question stole my heart. He is easily my favorite character in this series. My beautiful; pure; cinnamon roll; unbreakable boy. I stan one man from this series; and itâ€™s him. And he deserves everything good in the universe.
Breathtaking art meliescribbles
â€œWe don't choose what we are; but we choose what we do.â€
Overall; take this review with a large grain of salt. I am for sure in the minority with not loving these books as much as everyone else. And even though this isnâ€™t my favorite series; I think Victoria is incredibly talented and I canâ€™t wait to see what she does next. And I truly think that these books get better and better; with A Conjuring of Light being my favorite in the series; and the last couple chapters of this book had me smiling from ear to ear in pure happiness. And I ultimately do feel really fulfilled and happy with the ending. Plus; Iâ€™m very interested (especially after gushing with my friend Julie) with reading the graphic novel series set around a character from this world. Also; I have the highest of hopes for the spinoff that Victoria is working on. I just hope I fall completely head over heels in love; instead of only just enjoying.

you know that feeling when you've just walked out of the theater after watching a bomb! ass! movie! that has literally changed your entire being because you've; like; dementored the shit out of it and feel like you're 73% what you've just watched.
that's how i feel after finishing this aND I FEEL LIKE I CAN DO ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.
thankfully; i've retained some of my wits (although an argument can be made otherwise) and will not act on this feeling because i'm pretty sure someone'll just end up walking in on me slowly bleeding to death with my foot stuck in a hole in the wall as i try to enter a different universe.
this book has taken so much from me .............. my heart; my time; my dignity and i just think back to a few days ago where i was seriously concerned because i thought i wasn't really feeling anything for this book. i thought too much time between the first two had passed and now; this series was nothing more fond memory to be left in its place.
i know what you're thinking; who let this plebeian get an account on goodreads and spew this fAKE NEWS. to which i must say....... i hear ya; i respect ya; i'm there.
but then things happened and more things happened and those things turned into other things and the things almost ruined ma life and then things thing'd and i'm just here trying to survive The Things.
and if that makes no sense so you; then welcome to my life; where this book didn't leave me speechless but speechful and none of it makes any sense but i'm just feelings the feels right now.
because these characters find their way into your heart despite your best efforts and the writing is tOP NOTCH and the world-building leaves you breathless. i mean; it's been years since i've said to myself; holy hot darn do i wish this world was real and i was in it but ........ well........ holy hot darn to i wish this world was real and i was in it.
all i have left to say is that this series is over and i am Distraught.

Overview:
â€œAnoshe was a word for strangers in the street; and lovers between meetings; for parents and children; friends and family. It softened the blow of leaving.â€
Okay; I know my rating is picky and oddly specific; but itâ€™s true. I enjoyed this more than AGOS (making it my favorite of the series) but it's still just shy of 5 stars.
In fact; that's what I rated it in a blind-emotional fury immediately after I finished. Because there was a lot I loved. ...But also some stuff I didn't.
Another BR with Sana. (Even though she hated AGOS; smh.)
Pros:
I need to read another Schwab book like now. This series was my first experience with her writing and I love it. She utilizes crisp sentences and sensory details so I can completely visualize the scene. She expertly lets the scene rise and fall and is a master at setting tone.
Listen and let me tell you about my two new children: Rhy Maresh and Alucard Emery. I JUST REALLY LOVE BOTH OF THEM OKAY.
Rhy especially has a ton of character development. I laughed with him at the beginning and here my heart broke for him. He has to step up so much and really come into his own as a leader and I just love it.
Alucard and Kell bickering like old women is my new aesthetic. I could have honestly read a whole book about this; I swear. (But I also loved getting to see more of Lucâ€™s backstory and taking him more seriously)
The ending works very well. No spoilers; but everyone ends up in believable places and thereâ€™s certainly ramifications.
Speaking of which; the villain here is kind of awesome. Not quite the direction I was expecting for this series; but it works very well and I loved getting inside his head.
There are certain scenes the whole series seemed to be building towards and they are tense. Very well done and some of these really blew my mind.
Yes; hello it is I. Still loving Holland and just silently weeping in the background. Just such a dynamic character with such a strong presence on the page.
Cons:
At almost 700 pages; this is a little long. Places seemed overstuffed while others seemed off-topic; and there just some major pacing issues. The first 100 pages or so take off right after the explosive ending of AGOS; but then everything veers one direction and then another and sort of clambers together by the ending.
I really liked a lot of these elements; but couldnâ€™t help by feel they were a little random? This floating market idea was super cool and I loved the way it played out; but it literally came out of nowhere.
There were several characters who were expanded upon hereâ€”the king; queen; visitors from neighboring cities and others. While I really enjoyed their perspectives and how they impacted the story; it felt a little out of place to just now learn about these characters. I wish a lot of this started in the second book.
Listen: Lila is a fun character; but she has no development.
She seems almost exactly the same here as she did at the beginning of ADSOM. She definitely is fun; and I love how capable she is. But at some point the narrative switched to continually telling me what a bad-ass she is. She felt ridiculously over-powered. Why did the second book include a whole plot about magic having consequences and Kell warning her about her recklessness if nothing comes of it???

It softened the blow of leaving. Eased the strain of parting. A careful nod to the certainty of today; the mystery of tomorrow. When a friend left; with little chance of seeing home; they said anoshe. When a loved one was dying; they said anoshe. When corpses were burned; bodies given back to the earth and souls to the stream; those left grieving said anoshe.
Anoshe brought solace. And hope. And the strength to let go.
me: *slams fist on table* time to write acol review
inner me: you can't write a serious one even if they paid you
inner me: you're going to babble and yell incoherently
inner me: it would be full of cringe
inner me: and you will also cry
me: *slams two fists on table* THATS THE PLAN
I HONESTLY DONT KNOW WHERE TO START. SO MANY FEELINGS.
acol is a beautiful conclusion of one of my most favorite book series and i spent 10 minutes crying because it's over. i can't easily let my favorite characters and one of my favorite worlds go.
i pulled an allnighter to read this book; i binge read it for 11 hours; had like 2 hours of sleep in two days; paced around my flat like a fucking zombie numb and empty after i finished it and I REGRET NOTHING. i loved this book so much!!! it's so intense; action-packed and glorious. i enjoyed the story and all characters interactions and i WISH it would've been longer (even tho its 600+ pages lmao)
this book made me cry so fucking much though. like; i don't cry easily and GODDAMN IT VICTORIA why. acol made me feel so many things; it made me laugh; made me cry; made me so worried sometimes; i felt like dying. sometimes it was SO FUCKING CREEPY and sometimes it was so FLUFFY. also JEEZ there was no relaxing; something good happens and you're like 'oh phew' and then you turn the page AND SHIT HITS YOU IN THE FACE. pls give me a break????
i'm very sad that the story has ended but at the same time im very happy.
A Conjuring of Light may mark the end of one adventure; but remember: when it comes to this world; new doors are always being made.

!!!!!!!!!!
everything further contains spoilers which i won't mark as spoilers so PLEASE don't read it further if you haven't read the book yet
!!!!!!!!!!
listen; i expected it to be cool; but it was way cooler??? but what's with this KILLING SPREE. remember when victoria was like oh this book is 35% death and i was like phew it doesnt sound so bad AND THEN THIS BOOK MURDERED LIKE EVERY SIDE CHARACTER I CARED ABOUT AND I WAS LIKE WHAT THE FUCK VICTORIA. i cried the hardest at calla's death; maxim's death; hastra's death (omg i cant even think abt it without tearing up??? he thought he was a bad guard and then he saved kell and;;;;send help why did my tiny son die he should've been a priest but then kell might've died WHY) AND HOLLAND'S DEATH (i knew holland would die and i knew he would die like he did (finally free and calm but JESUS. FUCKING. CHRIST. i didn't know i have so many tears in me).
â€œDeath comes for us all;â€ said Holland evenly. â€œI would simply have mine mean something.â€
about holland though. for me he was the highlight of this book. i didn't like him in the first book and then agos happened and i softened to him BUT IN THIS FUCKING BOOK HE JUST BROKE MY HEART SO MANY TIMES MY SOFT SPOT FOR HIM IS THE SIZE OF OUR UNIVERSE. he got a redemption arc and this redemption arc is 9138483/10; his backstory made me cry so many times (like; his brother tried to kill him when he was a little boy???? a girl he loved and was happy with tried to kill him?? his best friend was killed and he couldn't save him??? he was tortured and captured and he couldn't do anything about it but just count his kills (i will never stop crying that he did it) and suffer??? and then it happened again after he just got free??? my poor tortured soN; i wanted to tuck him in the bed and cover him with all the blankets i have). i loved his interaction with kell so much and i loved holland so much and i can't convey my emotions about him in the text because DAMMIT he's totally the best character of this book and one of the best antagonists-but-not-really i've ever read about and can i have more characters like holland pretty please. i fucking started bawling when he trapped osaron and then i kept sobbing when he woke up and i couldn't stop weeping when he died because i knew it would happen and in a way it was a perfect ending for him (he died and his world lived and that is what he always desired and awknfaliefn im dead) but DAMN IT HURTS.
Lila met Hollandâ€™s gaze; expectingâ€”maybe even hopingâ€”to find that cold; implacable calm; perhaps tinged with disgust. Instead; she found shades of sadness; loss. And somehow; strength. The strength to go on. To try again. To trust.
i loved INTERACTIONS in this book so much.
kell and rhy are forever my most favorite brother duo. they love and care about each other so much i would die for them.
rhy and alucard are two idiots in love and i hope they're forever happy. alucard's backstory is so horrible (i cant believe his brother survived but good people didnt wtf can he jump off a cliff thank u very much nobody needs him) and i'm so happy that rhy understood and forgave him and wjskfeafjsklfskl pls be happy.
kell and lila (!!!!!!!!!!!!!). i shipped them from the very beginning AND THEY FINALLY GOT TOGETHER AND THEY'RE SOOO CUUUUTEEE. i love kell and lila and their relationship and the fact that kell would rather shoot himsef in the head than trust her (jk). i love how they're different but they complete each other in their own way. i love that the series wasn't really focused on their romance; but it's still enough and it's beautiful and i want to cri. also kell is very efficient teacher isnt he.
Ned stared at her with open awe. â€œYouâ€™re like him.â€
â€œNo;â€said Kell dryly; striding past him. â€œSheâ€™s one of a kind.â€
kell and alucard gave me life with their bickering.
kell and holland!!!!!!!!!!! good shit right here!!!!!!!!!! kell cared about holland and i cried at this and i wish it was different between them; like; holland is so older brother material for kell and AAAAAAAAAAAAA. and holland; too; was pretty fond of kell here i think. and i want to weep again because it could've been so much more.
ALSO THE SQUAD aka kell; rhy; lila and alucard. omg how much i loved that scene when they drank together and their interactions overall AND I WISH THERE WERE MORE because damn this is the squad i can read hours about.
THE THREE ANTARI. one of the best things that happened in this book. i wanted this from the very beginning and YESSSS kell; lila and holland finally worked together AND HOLLAND WAS THE ANCHOR; THE CENTER and this is perfect???
Lila looked to Kell. â€œYou didnâ€™t teach me this one.â€
His jaw was slack. â€œI â€¦I didnâ€™t know it.â€
Holland gave them both a bland look. â€œAmazing;â€he said dryly. â€œThere are still things you havenâ€™t learned.â€
i loved all characters in this book; and thanks to victoria schwab for creating them and i cant believe i have to say good bye to them.
*cries externally*
*cries internally*
*cries eternally*
as i already said im pretty satisfied with the closure. but i'm not satisfied with complete lack of backstory for lila. like; kell's parents thing was at least acknowledged; holland got a decent backstory that i will never stop crying about; but lila got nothing. i wanted to know more about her from the very beginning of the series and we didn't even get glimpses into her past. (i also don't understand how she almost died when kell said 93289894 times in adsom that antari are almost invincible and it's really hard; almost impossible to kill them and then bam lila could've died if holland didn't heal her. i understand that her wound was fatal but idk). pretty much only issues i have with this book tho.
overall; for me this book was perfect. fast; intense and exciting. i wish it weren't the end.
pls hold me while im crying
12108392810293/10
It wasnâ€™t a good-bye; not really.
What was the word for parting?
Anoshe.
That was it.
Until another day.
Anoshe.

hElp.
This is hands down my FAVORITE book from the Shades of Magic trilogy! It's rare for me to be satisfied with a conclusion to a series as a lot of the times the spark gets lost along the way but not in ACOL's case. It has everything I want in a conclusion and more!
â€¢ We get to see a different and a more in-depth side of some of our characters (ehem; my bby Holland *_*). However; I would have liked to know more about Lila and Kell's past since they're both still a mystery to me.
â€¢ Lots and lots and lots and lots of action (perhaps some deaths too?). Seriously; read it at your own risk ;)
â€¢ RHY RHY RHY RHY RHY.
â€¢ HOLLAND HOLLAND HOLLAND HOLLAND HOLLAND.
â€¢ Lila is even more reckless in this one but damn I still love her
â€¢ Kell and Alucard are such cutie pies. I live for their bickering :')
â€¢ Secondary characters that will make you fall in love and cry.
â€¢ Some more action. How do you defeat the undefeatable; you may ask? Read this book to find out :)
â€¢ THE ending will leave you sighing for days (at least I hope it does). I loved it.

Itâ€™s been a while.
The third and final volume in the Shades of Magic YA fantasy trilogy is everything it should be. It has plenty of action and drama although it slows down the pace from time to time to allow some breathing. There is death; as one should expect after the end of the 2nd volume; there is pain and loss but also hope; love and happiness.
The characters finally grow up and Lila is not so damn annoying; only a little bit. Alucard is amazing as expected and the other characters grew on me. We get to read the stories of some of the side characters and I was particularly touched by the Queenâ€™s as I see myself in some of her traits. In terms of relationships; the one between Alucard and Rhy was beautifully written and I could feel the love between them. On the other hand; there was no chemistry on paper between Lila and Kel. I felt that the author put them together only because she supposed to; it was not natural. The love scenes between them were lifeless; to say at least.
The magic was amazing as before although some of it was too convenient; such as the binding rings. I mean; what luck to find those exactly when needed.
This was my second YA fantasy series and I recommend it if you like these kind of books or fantasy in general. I was reluctant to try YA but after enjoying Grisha and this one; I wonâ€™t say no to others. (less)",89,NEXTBOOK

lol so; fuck this book for not giving me the ending i wanted. who am i kidding though; the day i started reading this book; Schwab decided it was a good day to HIGHLIGHT THE FUCKING ENDING for this damn book and spread that shit all over my feed. people commented the ending and my fucking traitorous eyes saw that damn spoiler so; Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
like; even though i knew that poor bby Holland was going to die; i didn't really get emotional until i actually read that part.
listen; before y'all start sharpening your knives and loading your guns to come and get me for rating this book three stars; hear me out:
â€»though this book was much more enjoyable and fast paced than the second; it was still 'meh' for me. i don't know there's just this really dull and bland feel to this story. no matter how much i enjoyed the first and this book; that dull feel to the plot is just there. the writing is just so emotionless???? for me????? IT'S JUST BLAND. ok.
-the characters
â€»so; Lila Bard

so this garbage shit. hmmmmmmmm
she became a bit more tolerable; though the same boring underdeveloped piece of shit whose death i would have gladly accepted :)
â€»Rhy Maresh
ok hi; i'm willing to lose my limbs for this flirty; adorable piece of shit. honestly; he's been through so much and he deserves hugs; cookies; and a lifetime of Tim Hortons. like; first Luc hurt him (i forgive Luc though) and then his parents got themselves slaughtered and this kid had to witness that and JUST TUCK HIM UNDER THE BLANKETS; HE'S TOO PURE FOR THIS WORLD.
â€»Kell Maresh
ok i really like his character in book 1; but then he just bored me to death in book 2. now in book 3; he's also meh; though 10x better than Lila bitch. (view spoiler) now if it were any other girl; i probably wouldn't have hated him too much; but i mean Lila. really Schwab???
-----AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I LOVED KELL AND LILA'S HAPPY ENDING. :) :) :) no srsly i was bursting with rainbows.
-and Alucard Emery
:)
:)

i love him.
(view spoiler)
ahaha i love him.
AND LET'S NOT FORGET what his brother did to him after he caught Luc with Rhy.
AHAHAHA NO PAIN AT ALL.
but srsly i'm happy Luc and Rhy got their happy ending after all the shit they've been through. i'm glad schwab decided to be nice and let them be happy. :-)
â€»Holland
oh boy; this precious bby. ok so; i thought he was an ass in book 1-LISTEN I DIDN'T KNOW THE DEAL WITH HIM OK; PUT THOSE KNIVES AWAY. but damn did his character develop like my grades dropping from semester 1 to 3 from a 90 to 65 :) ahaha not really but you get the idea. he's literally the most complex character and the amount of neglect and lack of love he gets from everyone makes my traitorous heart feel this pain; like he's such a sweetheart ugh. anyways; WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED WITH HIM AT THE END??? i'm so fucking confused???? in a way he gets peace (???) but like he dies???? what the fuck????? lol he's alive ok. he's. fucking. alive.
â€»Osaran (or whatever the fuck this bitch's name is)
lmao someone transport me into acol so i could cut this stupid fuck's ghostly dick off. i fucking hate this spirit bitch so much !!!!!!!!!!
he's a 10/10 villain; marry me
overall; ignore my rating; idk i might change it and bump it up to 4 stars; but seriously ignore my rating i have no idea what to feel about this book.
at times; i want to give it 2 stars; but then i want to give it 4; so i'll just settle for 3.

ALL THE STARS !!!
I won an advanced copy of this book through a Goodreads giveaway. Thank you!
To be honest; I'm not sure if this book would have been on my radar if I hadn't won it. Although the great reviews may have pulled me in. At any rate; I am so happy I read it.
I LOVED THIS BOOK !!
Just like it says in the title of the book; Eleanor Oliphant is completely fine....well she thinks she is. She is honestly not worried that she may be missing out on anything. She is content with her life.
Eleanor is a little bit....odd. She's very intelligent and well-spoken with impeccable grammar (thanks to Mummy) but she lacks the ability to filter what she says and therefore she will tell you exactly what she's thinking. This can lead to very awkward situations.
Eleanor is comfortable with her routines. She's worked at the same job for nine years. She starts work at 8:30; at lunch she buys a newspaper which she reads from cover to cover and then does the crossword. She finishes out her day; leaving work at 5:30. Eleanor listens to the Archers as she makes a simple dinner (usually pasta and salad - one pan one plate); watches TV or reads for a little while then off to bed at ten. Her weekday routine only changes on Wednesday when she talks with ""Mummy"" for ten minutes.
Weekends are a bit different. After work Friday she picks up pizza; wine and two big bottles of Vodka for the weekend. She drinks the vodka over the weekend.....in a state where she's neither drunk nor sober; waiting for Monday to come. No one comes over and she doesn't go anywhere to visit. She sometimes wonders if she's a figment of her own imagination.
But she's fine with it. She's fine. There's nothing missing; she doesn't need anyone else. Well that was what she told herself. But then it happens...
""He was light and heat. He blazed. Everything he came into contact with would be changed. I sat forward on my seat; edged closer. At last. I found him""
Now Eleanor is on a mission. First she decides a make-over is in order....and where she starts is both shocking and hilarious. I really want to write about what happened but I think I would spoil a very funny moment for many readers.
Things don't go exactly as planned.
When her computer at work stops working she meets Raymond from IT. An easy-going guy; Raymond is intrigued by Eleanor; but she's just not interested. She's busy trying to re-create herself for the man of her dreams. But after work one day Eleanor and Raymond come across a man who has fallen on the sidewalk. Together they help the man; Sammy and so begins a friendship along with the start of many changes in Eleanor's life.
The story is told from Eleanor's point of view. We go along for the ride as she navigates her way through her life; learning to stand up for herself. But it won't be easy. Secrets and memories that have been tucked away for many years can be painful to remember.
When you have trouble with social skills I can see how it would be easier to refrain from situations where things could go wrong so fast..... It would be easier being alone. As I mentioned there are many funny moments throughout the book. I really like how the author wrote these parts. I never felt like I was laughing AT Eleanor but at the things she said or the situations she ended up in. However; there are also many sad and painful moments. Times where I felt terrible for Eleanor.
Some of the funniest parts came out of nowhere - the phone doesn't ring often but if telemarketers call Eleanor whispers ""I know where you live"" and hangs up. Often it was what she would be saying to herself that was funny.
An incredible read that had me bouncing from one emotion to the next. The author did a tremendous job bringing these wonderfully unique characters to life.
It's hard to believe this is the author's debut novel.
There are so many words that can be used to describe this novel - hilarious ; unique; heartwarming; heartbreaking; charming; hopeful; inspiring; and COMPLETELY unforgettable.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! (less)",91,NEXTBOOK

I was completely unprepared for the life of Eleanor Oliphant and that of her â€Mummy.â€ To be frank; I was ill-equipped to deal with it; much like Eleanor. And it wrecked me.
At thirty years-old; Eleanor Oliphant is alone in this world. She always has been; actually. In and out of foster care since she was a little girl; she has never been touched by anyone in a loving way and doesnâ€™t even know what that would feel like; but thatâ€™s ok. All of her physical needs are met; you see and she has never had any emotional needs.
Seeing as she doesnâ€™t have any friends; Eleanor is quiet and socially awkward. Everyone thinks she is fairly strange; if you must to know. Not that she minds since peopleâ€™s behavior makes absolutely no sense to her. She is good at being alone and she does not feel sorry for herself. Not even when â€Mummyâ€™ calls and viciously tells her daughter off and berates her for being being â€œnaughty.â€ Eleanor; however wears a coat of armor and does her best to let her motherâ€™s words bounce off of her.
Eleanor has no aspirations though she has done accounting at an office for the last 9 years. Every day of her life is the same and she would be nothing without routine. One night; all of that changes rather abruptly. After work; she and a coworker named Raymond whom she just met and who happens to be leaving the office at the same time as her; find themselves in the exact right place at the right time. Both Eleanor and Raymond see a man (named Samuel); go down on the sidewalk and they go have a look see and discover that he needs an ambulance. This incident ends up tying the three together and becomes one of the most significant in Eleanor Oliphantâ€™s life. It forges a bond of friendship between them; which is something Eleanor has never experienced before in all her thirty years.
During this time; Eleanor also ends up finding him. The man she has been waiting for all of her life. The man she is meant to be with. Now she just has to get him to notice her. In trying to do so; Eleanor grows bolder and more confident. She also learns to lean on and open herself up to her new friends.
Throughout the book; Eleanor slowly experiences a metamorphosis; one that often makes you smile; laugh and of course; cry. She is damaged and quirky but oh so special. I loved her dearly. For more reasons than one. I identified with Eleanor Oliphant you see; and for that; I was unprepared. I did say that this book wrecked me right?! I get why Eleanor is Completely Fine. She had no choice. Unfortunately; Eleanorâ€™s â€Mummyâ€™ is someone I recognized fairly well. When I heard her voice (in a Scottish accent) on the audiobook; and the way she spoke to her daughter; my chest got tight and my throat closed up and I sobbed. Unlike Eleanor's â€œMummyâ€ however; mine happens to be British instead of Scottish - though the accents are close; thus I therefore guess that listening to the audiobook had an even more profound effect on me. Iâ€™ve had similar conversations; in case it wasnâ€™t obvious and I felt Eleanorâ€™s pain more deeply as it related to her â€Mummyâ€™; for at certain times in my life; it mirrored my own. All that aside however; Eleanor does not go quietly into the dark goodnight (and neither did I; for what itâ€™s worth).
Though it affected me greatly; â€œEleanor Oliphant is Completely Fineâ€ is without a doubt one of the most incredible; profound; and beautifully well written novels I have absorbed in ages. It wrecked me in the best and worst ways possible. In case itâ€™s not obvious; it will stay with me for a long time. I think I came across it on purpose as both Eleanor Oliphant and I needed something from it and I think we were both lucky enough to receive it.

She goes to her office job five days a week and then treats herself to a frozen pizza and a bottle of vodka on a weekend. She lives alone and doesn't have any friends; but that's okay. She's doing real well; thank you very much.
Except maybe she isn't.
Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine caught me completely unawares. I'll be honest - I picked it up because it got some buzz and the author is British; but it actually turned out to be one of those perfectly-balanced sad/funny books. Maybe like some combination of The Rosie Project; Me Before You; Finding Audrey and A Man Called Ove. It takes a serious; traumatic issue and weaves it into a warm; funny and; yes; sometimes sad tale.
I read a lot of books and many characters come and go. Some are well-developed and interesting; others less so. But on a rare occasion I find one of those truly memorable characters that will stay with me a long time. Eleanor is one of them. She is socially clueless in a way that puts my teen self to shame. She is literal to a degree that everyone finds odd. It's painful to witness and yet so; so endearing.
I think I like this book so much because it is actually really sad; but never manipulative. On a surface level; it's a very funny novel about a socially-inept twenty-nine year-old woman. Her attempts to become ""normal"" and integrate into society by having manicures and waxes are sources of hilarity. But it is very sad. It's sad when we see her coworkers talking about her; but Eleanor is oblivious to their scorn. It's sad how alone in life she is. It's sad when she ""falls in love"" with an idea of a person.
It's not a romantic book and I'm glad. There are hints that the central relationship will eventually develop into romance; but this is really a book about Eleanor. I am thankful that the author didn't cure Eleanor and lead her out of the darkness by having her fall in love. Being happy and achieving greater self-worth should; in my opinion; never be linked to romance.
I really enjoyed it. It's great to find a book so packed full of emotion without seeming overly-sentimental.

All apologies to my lovely Goodreads friends who have liked (or loved) this book; but it's not for me.
And it's sad. . . because I wanted it; I waited for it; and I was finally able to start it. It's Mother's Day; and my family handed me bath salts and my new book and told me to go for it. They know I'm just crazy enough to read an entire book in one bath; and I was ready to do it.
And I prepared my bath; and I began reading; and I was (very quickly) almost in physical pain. I don't mean to be rude to the author; I know how hard it is to write a novel and get it published; but this would not have made it past my eyes; if she had handed it to me.
Again; ALL APOLOGIES; but this is Mother's Day; and you have one annoyed mother on your hands. You have ruined my bath; and in doing so; you have released the Kraken!!
MUST the reader be invited in to experience every one of Eleanor's bowel movements and meals? MUST we suffer through every not-interesting-in-the-least observation on life?
And; how must we EVER believe that a woman this bizarre would be able to function in the world and/or experience a friendship or a romance?
According to Eleanor; she has ""white contours of scar tissue that slither across my right cheek."" Here's where I just about threw the book. Explain. No; seriously. Explain how scar tissue slithers across a face. Do you mean as you are speaking or making funny faces? Did you attend Hogwarts? Are you a Slytherin? Help; please!
Also. . . somehow. . . Eleanor hangs up phones quietly. But; it's 2017; and we all just use that little button now. There's no loud; there's no quiet; there's just that one button. Explain.
Oh; and when she hangs up the phone with her Mummy (choke and gag); ""It was only when the air went dead that I noticed I'd been crying.""
How does the air go dead? No; I'm not kidding. Please; explain what that sounds like; what it looks like. How does the air go dead?
If you want to read about a WAY more adorable person with Asperger's. . . go find Don Tillman. If you want to read about a WAY more delightful curmudgeon; go find Olive Kitteridge.

What an incredible story!
â€œThese days; loneliness is the new cancer - a shameful; embarrassing thing; brought upon yourself in some obscure way. A fearful; incurable thing; so horrifying that you dare not mention it; other people donâ€™t want to hear the word spoken aloud for fear that they might too be afflicted.â€
Eleanorâ€™s story hit me so much harder than I expected it to. She is thirty years old; has worked at the same job since she left university; speaks on the phone to mummy once a week and drinks two litres of vodka every weekend. Eleanor Oliphant is fine.
One day; Eleanor and a colleague help assist an elderly man whoâ€™d fallen over on the street. From there we follow Eleanor and Raymondâ€™s budding friendship; and we realise just how â€not fineâ€™ Eleanor truly is.
â€œIâ€™d tried so hard; but something about me just didnâ€™t fit. There was; it seemed; no Eleanor-shaped social hole for me to slot into.â€
Eleanor is painfully relatable; her awkwardness at social encounters; reliance on alcohol and the burying of all feelings and past grievances; is something I feel on a personal level. Itâ€™s as if her story came to me at just the right time in my life. It was heartbreaking; honest and powerful.
â€œI was thirty years old; I realised; and I had never walked hand in hand with anyone. No one had ever rubbed my tired shoulders; or stroked my face.â€
All of us have felt alone at some point in our lives; Eleanorâ€™s story serves as a reminder that we are a lot more alike than we realise. A bit of kindness can go such a long way; friendship can truly be life saving. (less)",95,NEXTBOOK

Thank you; Eleanor Oliphant. Thank you for picking me up out of my reading slump. Thank you for being so funny; so sad; so smart; so blunt. Thank you for being a literary character that will live forever in the hearts of (most) anyone that reads you.
Oh; and a big thank you for enriching my own personal vocab. My Kindle dictionary has never had such a workout. What a nice perk!! Effortless writing that flows naturally fast; even though Eleanor O prefers to use crossword type clues as actual everyday language. She is a piece of work! And I adore her.
I didnâ€™t want this book to end. No; seriously did not want it to end; so why did I devour it as fast as ice cream melting at a picnic? Because it is that good! My black; black heart doesn't always have to read about murders and mysteries. I love a feel good story as much as the next guy. I just need it to be the right kind of writing (GOOD; NOT cheesy). The right kind of character (layered; quirky; UNIQUE). I have to admit; I wasn't a huge fan of A MAN CALLED OVE. Ove did not strike me as a real person. He felt artificial and a bit contrived. Made up. Eleanor O; on the other hand; is real.
This is the right kind of everything. Thank you; Ms. Honeyman; for writing it. I actually feel sad for other books that try so hard to achieve the big feels and don't even come close to Eleanor Oliphant.
I've meant to read this for at least a year now and finally was nudged into it by my bookclub IRL! If this is on your TBR and you haven't read it yet; ahhhhhhh; I envy you. Don't wait a minute longer. Do it now! (less)",96,NEXTBOOK

I'll admit; when I started reading Gail Honeyman's debut novel; Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine ; I thought about issuing a moratorium on quirky characters who can't seem to pick up social cues or are oblivious to how people usually behave when interacting with peers; coworkers; those who provide service; and others. Obviously these are colorful characters to write aboutâ€”it seems as if the literary world is full of them.
But the more time I spent with Eleanor Oliphant; I realized that her behavior was more the result of circumstance than will; nurture if you will; rather than nature. And then I thought about how boring the world might be if everyone acted the way they were expected to; said the right things; and never expressed their true feelings. (Lord knows if I couldn't roll my eyes; my head might explode.)
Eleanor lives by her routines. She eats the same meals; wears the same clothes; has her weekly chat with Mummy; and has her weekend rituals; which include frozen pizza and enough vodka to keep her pleasantly drunk all weekend. For the most part; she eschews interactions with her coworkers; whom she mostly thinks are daft and lazy. They make fun of her both behind her back and in front of her; and she doesn't really care.
""I do not light up a room when I walk into it. No one longs to see me or hear my voice. I do not feel sorry for myself; not in the least. These are simply statements of fact.""
Two things happen which throw her routines off-kilter. First; while attending a concert with a coworker; she spots a handsome musician and is quickly smitten. She has decided that he is the one for her; and starts to ready herself for their first encounter; during which she knows he'll sweep her off her feet and they'll live happily ever after. She needs a makeover and new clothes; and she starts doing research on her soon-to-be-beloved.
Meanwhile; one afternoon she and Raymond; the IT guy from her office; whom she considers poorly groomed and a bit bumbling; save the life of an elderly man who falls in front of them. Saving Sammy's life suddenly gives Eleanor two unexpected relationships; friendships; that she has never had before. She still acts the way she believes to be appropriate; and says things that most wouldn't; but she begins liking the feeling of belonging; of companionship; which she never realized she wanted.
""Some people; weak people; fear solitude. What they fail to understand is that there's something very liberating about it; once you realize that you don't need anyone; you can take care of yourself. That's the thing: it's best just to take care of yourself. You can't protect other people; however hard you try. You try; and you fail; and your world collapses around you; burns down to ashes.""
Eleanor's social awkwardness; her lack of a filter; her inability to grasp exactly how people expect her to behave; actually hides a great deal of secret pain; pain and memories even she has hidden. And when she is forced to start recognizing just what a burden she has carried for so much of her life; and who was responsible; it threatens to break her. Suddenly she realizes she may need to do something she never hasâ€”depend on others; and reveal things about herself she's always kept hidden; in order to move forward. If she wants to.
Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine is really a special book. Even if some of Eleanor's behaviors are similar to other quirky characters you might have seen; she is totally unique; and while off-putting; just absolutely wonderful. You both marvel and are saddened by the burdens she has carried; and how she copes with them. I found myself becoming protective of her; worrying there would come an instant where someone made a total fool out of her (with her own help; of course).
Honeyman really did a terrific job with Eleanor. Even as she began letting down her guard; Honeyman kept her character consistent; but never let her become unsympathetic. While this is certainly Eleanor's story; I liked the other characters as well; although they certainly didn't get as much attention. I thought the ending was a little too pat for my taste; but I really enjoyed this overall; and don't think I'll be forgetting Eleanor or her story anytime soon.
God bless the people who challenge our notions of ""appropriate"" and ""normal;"" because they are what keeps our world interesting!

She works at a graphic design firm in the finance department and spends the rest of her time at home; usually drinking. Her social life consists of a phone call with her mummy every week. Then one day she goes to a concert; for which she won tickets in a raffle; and falls in love at first sight with a musician. Eleanor decides to make some changes to herself as part of a plan to get her dream man. Meanwhile a new hire in the IT department of her company; Raymond; strikes up a friendship with Eleanor. As things change for Eleanor she is forced to confront the past and confront the real reason for her recent desire for more.
I really enjoyed this; oh man Eleanor is so quirky and endearing. Her inner monologue was excellent and I could really relate to her. I had an especially visceral reaction when (view spoiler) because come on who hasn't had a moment like that. I've had my fair share of moments when I try really hard and then just feel embarrassed and stupid about everything I've done. Eleanor just felt so real and human. The only thing that annoyed me was the ending when (view spoiler) because it felt unnecessary and I didn't think we needed a plot twist like it kind of ruined all her conversations with her mom for me a little bit.

She has had a scarred childhood; though we don't learn exactly what happened until later in the story; she wears the evidence on her face. She remembers little from that time only knows she was burned in a fire. Raised in a series of group homes; given an apartment by social services who still check on her though she is now thirty. She has few social skills; is very matter of fact; has no friends; few filters and has a schedule that she keeps to; a job she likes and insists she is fine. Until a crush with a musician and an IT guy named Raymond derails her schedule and her life.
Why did I give this five stars? It is a first book; with nary a misstep; an assured book with amazing writing and character development. Plus it is difficult to take a book with so few characters; and not only make it interesting enough to keep the reader immersed; but to let us see the way Eleanor changes and grows throughout the story. There is much humor; there is also sadness and I came to embrace this character in all her strangeness; loved when she figured things out and came to terms with her past. There are a few places where the author could have gone overboard on sweetness but she kept true to the character of Eleanor and just managed to stay on the border; without crossing over. This is a book I will remember; it was that good and meaningful; in my opinion.
Looking forward to great things from this new author; she is a true talent.

Itâ€™s a lonely life she leads and she says everything is fine but we learn eventually that it isnâ€™t; and that life hasnâ€™t ever been fine. While hints of what happened to her are slowly divulged; we never really find out everything until the end . Itâ€™s heartbreaking to learn why she drowns herself in alcohol and fantasizes about a guy in a band; wanting a guy to love her; scars and all; the ones on the outside and those in her heart.
Although; there is some humor to be found here; this really is such a profoundly sad story. I found it very difficult to read at times; especially hearing the disturbing things that she tells us her mother says to her in their weekly conversations. Sheâ€™s ridiculed and laughed at by her coworkers except for the seemingly odd Raymond; the IT guy with whom she becomes friends. Suddenly Eleanor Is living parts of the life that her past had taken away from her. She slowly gets to know a little of the world that she had hidden herself from for so many years behind the walls of her apartment and large quantities of vodka. Iâ€™m almost at a loss for anything further to say; except that Iâ€™m sorry I waited so long to read this book. I didnâ€™t get to it right away because I really thought it was just another quirky book and I couldnâ€™t have been more wrong. Itâ€™s about how people can impact each otherâ€™s lives in unbearably awful ways and how others rise to save them. A fantastic debut that is not to be missed. (less)",100,NEXTBOOK

I laughed. I thought about crying. I was angry. I was delighted. I was empathetic. I was completely fine; sometimes.
What started out as a book that could have easily been called A Woman Called Eleanor ended up being far superior to that Ove stuff. There were legit moments that made me laugh; and the book turned in directions that were hard to get through; assuming you have a heart inside your chest that beats about 65bpm as mine does. A heart that feels emotion and pumps blood at the same time. Have you one of those? Are you human?
This could have easily been just a three-star; that was nice; thanks; see ya later kind of book. It wasnâ€™t. It was a cut above that because it had memorable characters and situations and relationships and conditions and events and circumstances that made it a more powerful book than I anticipated. The last third of the book was heavy.
This thing took me all over the place emotionally... and physically. I mean I guess I physically took this book all over the place since I read it on my phone and also listened to the audiobook. Whatever. I didnâ€™t read the synopsis. I just liked the cover and people I like liked the book so I just went for it. Iâ€™m glad I did. I should go for more things in life. Take more risks. Thatâ€™s what life is all about. Taking risks and reading books without knowing too much about them.
Life is also about other things; too. Some of those other life things can be found in the pages of this book. Others canâ€™t be found in any book because they just have to be experienced in; you know; real life. Experiences are good.
So hereâ€™s another book for me to recommend. If I recommend anything; itâ€™s worth your time. I donâ€™t recommend anything unless Iâ€™m 100% sure everyone in the entire world will agree with me. So here I am; confidently recommending this book to you all because I know you will thoroughly enjoy it much the same way I did; and perhaps even more; but definitely not less.

This writer is so clever! We've got the first part of elephant at the beginning of her first name; and the rest of the elephant in the last name. No; of course this book is not about elephants; but the writer sometimes plays with words--and that alone is a selling point for me. Maybe it's sort of like subliminal advertising; except the author isn't trying to sell us elephants. Eleanor Oliphant. Elephant elephant elephant!
I can get all analytical and talk about how Eleanor--the fact that half of her face is badly scarred and that no one knows (or dares to ask) how she got that wayâ€”is the elephant in the room. (In fact; the author makes a pun once; referring to an Oliphant in the room.) And like an elephant; Eleanor Oliphant indeed fills the room; even though she would prefer that no one see her; that everyone leave her alone. The world is too scary to her and she is the poster child for anti-social behavior. In one venture she is completely delusional--she thinks her crush on a famous person will lead to marriage. She is a riot; but she has no idea she is. It's also true that she's sad and feels isolated and unlovable. Formal; literal; awkward; and very very funny in her skewed world view; are also part of her package. Routines; crossword puzzles; and vodka are her mainstays. I usually like oddball characters; Eleanor is definitely one of my favorites. Her character is so well-drawn; I'll remember her I'm sure.
This book sure isn't all laughs and all light by any means. This is also a dark book. Something awful happened to Eleanor when she was a kid; and throughout the book we get hints about what it is. The ending had a very clever surprise that made me shake my head in wonder. I loved it.
The middle of the book dragged a little for me; which made me call it a 4-star read at first. (I just had to change my rating to 5 stars; though--the book is just too damn good and I can't get Eleanor out of my head.) Eleanor has a hilarious adventure in a salon early on (one I just have to reread); and there's a lot of other funny energy. Absurd situations described in language that hopped; gave me the feeling that I was on an amusement ride. The author seemed â€œonâ€; jazzed up; and I couldnâ€™t get off the ride even if I wanted to. Of course; I wanted the book to keep up that level of hilarity; and it didn't. Still; Eleanor was relentlessly fascinating; both her public; regular side (thatâ€™s a poor choice of words because there is nothing regular about Eleanor) and her private; dark side.
I recommend this book wholeheartedly. I'm shocked that this is a debut--it's so well-written; and the lovable; weird heroine is so so vivid. I'll be in line for the author's next book; although this book will be a hard act to follow. (less)",102,NEXTBOOK

Here is the review I wrote right after I read it. I realize - almost a year later I can still remember so much about this story: ELEANOR is a terrific character ... and this book is great!!! Even GROWS on you!!!
Eleanor Oliphant; almost 30 years old; is one of those odd characters we think we may have seen before in our books --- lonely - awkward - lacking social skills. She doesn't have filters when it comes to saying what she's thinking. Yet....Eleanor Oliphant has a
uniqueness that only she can claim.
Eleanor goes to the same office job - M-F 8:30 to 5:30 every day. She works as a finance clerk. She takes an hour lunch break. We know her weekday supper routines and her weekend menu. Weekends are frozen pizza; vodka; and phone chats with Mummy.
Eleanor's life changes after she meets Raymond; a co-worker IT guy. His sloppy -unkempt style doesn't bother Eleanor-she never had any friends to begin with and she wasn't a fashion queen herself.
Raymond and Eleanor help a man; Sammy; who took a fall -- and the three of them become allies for each other. They begin to unleash from their individual isolated lives
and bond together in a heartwarming friendship.
This story really makes you realize how valuable one friend can be. Eleanor had been stuck in ways she didn't even have the eyes to see - let alone do anything about it.
But it's Raymond -his goodness- that ultimately helps Eleanor mend her broken heart....by helping her face areas of her painful childhood she has avoided.
The story is broken down into three sections:.
Good Days
Bad Days
Better Days
Tender- touching - and plenty of heart.
This is another book that I read last yearâ€¦ The book was given to me last summer. I wrote a review but I have no idea where it is.
I do remember enjoying it!! I still have the book in my house. I'm walking now; I can research the review or look through the book later but it was quirky and enjoyable.......NEVER FOUND IT THROUGH GR's .... but I had a copy! (less)",103,NEXTBOOK

She calls herself a self contained entity; eating lunch alone while doing crossword puzzles and spending every weekend alone with bottles of vodka. She feels freakish and ugly since she has scar tissue across her right cheek; a result of third degree burns suffered during childhood. She speaks to Mummy by phone every Wednesday. Eleanor lives with the only item to have survived her childhood; her parrot plant; Polly. Having been raised from age ten in the foster care system; she has no appropriate social skills. Society has kept her fed; clothed and educated; but unloved.
Mummy's phone calls are hurtful and abusive. Mummy tells Eleanor that she's let people down; can't be trusted and that her facial scars show the past living on her face. Despite this criticism; she embarks upon a mission to find a boyfriend or husband. This will keep Mummy happy. Eleanor decides to change her outward appearance to attract dreamy rock musician; Johnnie Lomond.
Raymond;a co-worker from the IT department of her office; starts a budding friendship with Eleanor after both of them assist an accident victim. Through Raymond's kindness and ministrations; Eleanor's inner emotions and feelings slowly start to emerge. She revisits her childhood memories with help from Raymond; her first real friend. Confronting her past will enable her to change the trajectory of her life.
Eleanor Oliphant had a tumultous; mindboggling upbringing. Her journey is one of hope for a better future; a future fought for and won by facing her demons and disassociating herself with the perpetrator(s) of abuse. ""Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine"" by Gail Honeyman is an excellent debut novel.

She is brilliant; yet socially awkward. At the age of 10 she experienced a trauma that she never received any help with to sort through it. So; she repressed her memories and more importantly; she repressed her emotions. By the age of 30; she was so good at repression that it completely froze parts of her being and the underlying; unacknowledged fear of any of her repressions getting out were the root cause of her lack of social skills.
When dealing with intellectual matters; she is formidable; her vocabulary and the facts at her fingertips are beyond many peopleâ€™s comprehension. Yet even as she grew and matured; some parts of her remained in the stunted; closed-in world of her 10-year-old self.
Despite everything she had experienced; with both physical scars and those on her psyche; not once does Eleanor feel self-pity or get caught up in; â€œI am a victimâ€. She simply does not see herself that way and it is one of the reasons I admire her as a character to be honoured and respected.
At her workplace; she meets the new IT guy Raymond; and her critique of him is definitely offhand and dismissive. Although they do eventually become friends; Eleanor has her sights set on someone else â€“ far more glamourous; exciting; and sophisticated.
When her world takes a nose dive; she is wise enough to know it is because of her own poor decisions based on influences from her past; and she takes brave measures to turn her life around with help from her friend Raymond. Her long and slow recovery is a testament to the human soulâ€™s willingness to strive and thrive against all odds.
I found this book to be a compelling read; funny in places; deadly serious in other places; but always; always buoyed by Eleanorâ€™s determination and resilience. It was rewarding to watch her friendship with Raymond grow; and his support of her is inspiring.
I loved this book; it is yet another amazing debut novel by an author I hope to read more of in the future. This one is going straight to my Favourites shelf; and I know that if ever I need inspiration; all I need do is think about Eleanor Oliphant! (less)",106,NEXTBOOK

I just loved Eleanor! She is a loner and avoids social interactions and lives in isolation. She speaks out without thinking; to whatever pops in her mind. She has never received hugs; or held hands and has never felt loved; she never received anything when she was sad to cheer her up. Never received balloons and received a balloon from Raymond with Sponge Bob on it and it was so special to her. She never heard of Sponge Bob.
She had an awful childhood with a scar on her face and bruises would show up all over her body. She had an emotional traumatic past. She was bought up in foster homes and then gets herself her own apartment from a social worker.
Eleanor is now thirty years old and works in a office. She drinks a lot of vodka and spends time on the weekends talking to her Mummy on the telephone. She drinks her vodka so she can forget her traumatic past; all what she remembers is a fire. She then goes through counseling and things come together and she remembers everything that
happened in her traumatic past
She then meets Raymond and things start to change for her; she finally meets a friend. She is in love with a famous musician. That is how quirky she is; she actually wants a relationship with him. Her relationship with Raymond builds and it works for her. She then goes through counseling and things come together and she remembers everything that happened in her traumatic past. She is changing and turns out being very brave. She is so humorous. I just loved Eleanor.
My Thoughts
This book really made me feel so many emotions!! I laughed; I cried; tears running down my face. I cheered for Eleanor near the end. I loved this book. It really made me feel! I just loved Eleanor.
It was a slow burn but the book started building suspense when I read about her scar on her face and had to find out why. Then it got me turning the pages to find out what happened. I was so surprised when I found out what happened. It was so sad and heartbreaking what she went through. While I was reading this I thought it was a whole different genre in what I usually read; it wasn't a thriller but it was the mystery of what happened that turned this into a page turner. Once all the pieces came together; I fell in love with this book. I can understand why it was a little slow; you needed to really get to know Eleanor. Once I started loving Eleanor that is when it started getting really good. I then couldn't put it down. Eleanor will make you laugh; she will make you cry; and she will have you cheering her on. If you love a book that will make you feel; this is the one for you!! I loved it.
This book was an awesome character driven novel. I just loved Eleanor's character. (less)",107,NEXTBOOK

4.5 Stars
Eleanor Oliphant is lacking the social awareness that would have her filter her comments; or even consider for a moment that she needs to do so. Sheâ€™s a unique individual with a unique view on the world and how it works â€“ especially as it relates to people.
â€Animals; birds and insects can provide such useful insights. If Iâ€™m ever unsure as to the correct course of action; Iâ€™ll think; â€What would a ferret do?â€™ or â€How would a salamander respond to this situation?â€™ Invariably; I find the right answer.â€
Approaching 30 years old; Eleanor is a charming; quirky; socially naÃ¯ve; emotionally awkward young woman who leads a lonely life; she has worked in the same office for eight years now; in the same job; a finance clerk. She has her routine down and no aspirations for the future of rising in the ranks. An hour for lunch; her crossword puzzles; her weekly conversations with Mummy; these are the constants of her life. Variations in routine send her into a momentary tizzy; too many deviations send her reaching for her vodka. She avoids socializing; but will make an appearance as needed for a work related event; but only to avoid more unwanted attention that she would undoubtedly be subjected to should she choose not to attend. Ideally; she would prefer to blend in with the paintings on the walls; the furniture; the woodwork. That is; until she sees him; the man Mummy always told her would be right for her. For him; she might risk being seen.
When she requires IT help at work; she meets Raymond; she does a quick assessment of his grooming and wardrobe shortcomings; while he is new enough not to be put off by her awkwardness; he leaves her feeling as though he views her as normal â€“ which in itself is an oddity in her workplace.
In the awkward getting-to-know-you phase of a work friendly relationship; Raymond and Eleanor happen to be in the right place at the right time; at least for Sammy Thom; when they see him collapse in the street. Suddenly; they are thrust into Sammyâ€™s life; sitting bedside at his hospital bed; hoping for his recovery; meeting his family; and becoming an extended part of Sammyâ€™s family.
Eleanor is prodded into forsaking her routines; stepping outside of her comfort zone once Raymond and Sammy enter the picture. She begins to feel noticed in a good way; and begins to try to believe in life; in goodness. Believe in someone besides Mummy.
Little by little I was charmed by this overwhelmed; damaged woman-child; her odd view of the world; her dislike of proper grammar when texting; her take on â€œhuman mating ritualsâ€ such as flirting; her incredulity that anyone would want to be her friend; her slow unearthing of her own voice; her discovery that others might enjoy her company. It felt a little bit like that iconic moment in 1984â€™s Academy Awardâ€™s acceptance speech; when Sally Field said: â€œYou like me; right now; you like me!â€
â€ I was getting to quite like my own voice; my own thoughts. I wanted more of them. They made me feel good; calm even. They made me feel like me.â€
Although this covers some rather calamitous childhood events; it is done without any sensationalism. It incorporates some of the coping mechanisms; as well as some of the causes of the physical and emotional scars of her childhood.
Eleanor Oliphant shows us the significance of kindness; the consequence of the absence of kindness; and the magnitude of even a small gesture of kindness.
A wonderfully uplifting debut novel!

But for now; I'm going to revel in it until it comes to an end. Here's to hoping that never happens.¥‚
My heart; without a doubt; has been hijacked by Eleanor and is nowhere to be found.
But you know what; Eleanor; take it. Take whateverâ€™s left of it. Itâ€™s all yours because you've given me a blissful (and melancholic) reading experience. Œ
Eleanor completely snuck up on my emotions and her story overall touched me in ways that I never expected. I became so attached to her that when I was nearing the end I dreaded reading the book because I wasn't ready to say goodbye yet.
There are a number of books out there about various types of mental health issues; however; not many that talk about profound loneliness as the central plot point. Enter; Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine.
This novel will emotionally gut punch you while making you smile and laugh; then comfort you with moving words until it decides you've had enough laughter and... back to the punches again. What a beautiful rollercoaster.

A fearful; incurable thing; so horrifying that you dare not mention it; other people donâ€™t want to hear the word spoken aloud for fear that they might too be afflicted; or that it might tempt fate into visiting a similar horror upon them.""
I couldnâ€™t help but think that the above presumption somehow rings quite true in this day and age. If we look around and see so many interacting personally with their cell phones rather than one another; and think about the hordes of people sitting at home in front of the television watching mindless shows or playing video games; and those of usâ€¦ ahem; sitting at our computers alone but attempting to engage with others online â€“ I am nearly convinced that loneliness could very well be a disease of this technologically advanced century.
Eleanor Oliphant certainly knows something about loneliness. In fact; it was this issue that really stood out for me the most in this novel. I mean; yes; there are a number of other problems to reflect on here as well â€“ alcoholism; mental abuse; and physical abuse for starters. And then it seems we could also touch on Aspergerâ€™s. In fact; I think you could open up a copy of a DSM-5 if you had one handy (I didnâ€™t) and slap quite a few official diagnoses under Eleanorâ€™s name. However; I really donâ€™t mean to make light of any of Eleanorâ€™s problems because even just one of these would be enough to make me feel for this quirky and solitary soul. Initially; Eleanor is a bit unlikeableâ€¦ judgmental; aloof; and not always very nice â€“ she just might tell you exactly what she thinks. She is also quite funnyâ€¦ not purposefully; of course; but I dare you not to laugh about some of her observations! In the very least; you may nod your head. ""I do feel that tube tops are best suited to the under twenty-fives; if; indeed; they are suited to anyone."" And then she little by little grows on you as you learn her story and you not only sympathize with her; you might actually find yourself caring for her and cheering her on.
There are a number of excellent reviews out there so I wonâ€™t dwell more on Eleanorâ€™s personal history or the plot here. The balance seems to be overwhelmingly tipped in favor of this book; but there are some fantastic reviews that also sit on the other side of the scale and are well worth their weight. There were some things that bugged me while reading this - a number of inconsistencies in Eleanorâ€™s character; for example. She would say one thing and then act in an opposing manner. An unbelievable love interest comes to mind immediately. And what about the vodka binge drinking? ""Vodka is; for me; merely a household necessity; like a loaf of bread or a packet of tea."" Does one quit this without a recovery process? Are there no withdrawal symptoms? Okay; enough said about that.
However; despite several of these inconsistencies; I could not help being entirely charmed by this novel! I seriously adored Raymond! I like to think that there really is that nice guy (or gal) out there that will make a difference in someoneâ€™s life â€“ a person who doesnâ€™t necessarily shine when you first glance at him or her; but one with that unassuming presence whose friendship is truly priceless. My personal enjoyment of the book as well as the importance of bringing the issue of loneliness into the forefront are what tipped the scale in the right direction for me.

I only quite recently realised I had any when a friend pointed it out; and all the years of struggling - my thoughts; emotions and behaviour started to make sense. Funny thing is; I had decided to read this one thinking it was going to be a fun; light read and it will cheer me up. Little did I know how deep and relatable it was going to turn out.
Initially; I could only manage a couple of pages at a time because it's all my brain could take; and I didn't want to overwork myself. But the more I read; the more I wanted to know about Eleanor. Though she took me a while to warm up to; I really got to know her and like her as a person. And now I just adore her! She was a wonderful character and seemed so incredibly REAL to me that at times I forgot I was reading a work of fiction. It felt like I was literally inside her head with her thoughts and emotions. She was funny; quirky; so odd at times and yet SO relatable. I identified and connected with Eleanor on a personal level because I too; know what the darkness feels like; the hollowness and loneliness. I know it all too well.
I felt angry and hurt for Eleanor and for what she went through. Her mother was an incredibly vile woman. But I got to see her grow and blossom beautifully; and it was so heartwarming to be a part of it all. I found myself thinking of Eleanor when I wasn't reading; and then would want to pick it up just so that I could be a part of her thoughts and her day.
Reading for me in some ways is an escape from my issues because it makes me feel better. I started this book in a state where I felt at my lowest; but finished it in a better one. Partly because I really enjoyed the book and mainly because I finally decided to confide in my friend. Just like Eleanor; I bottled things up. But I think it's very important to let someone know about how you feel. And I'm glad I picked this one up because it made me smile and laugh and I had a wonderful time reading it. I didn't realise this until now but I'm actually going to miss Eleanor Oliphant. And she most definitely; and completely; is fine.

Our story is a simple one. Eleanor is the poster girl for loneliness and social isolation caused by having a frightful childhood resulting in a truly traumatic event (no spoiler : a house fire). Eleanor is 30 and has zero friends; less than zero family; a poorly paid job; doesnâ€™t speak to her co-workers; doesnâ€™t even have a cat or a dog or a budgie or a little worm as a pet. Not even a little tiny worm!
Eleanor has a ridiculously pompous conversational style. So unfamiliar with normal human interaction is Eleanor that she has not realised that most people do not want to be spoken to as if they are in a posh drawing room in the 1950s. Itâ€™s like she has lived without tv or radio or newspapers or magazines or anything.
Example number one :
â€œLet us retire to an inn or public house; Raymond â€“ a quiet one â€“ and please; allow me to buy you some beer in recompense for this wasted evening.â€
Example two :
â€œYou donâ€™t need to stay long â€“ just show face; have a cup of tea; eat a sausage roll â€“ you know the drill.â€ Said Raymond.
â€œWell I hope theyâ€™ve at least got a high meat content and friable pastry; â€œ I said.
Example three: when she gets a cat (oops; spoiler!) she says :
I will assume the mantle of careâ€¦ This creature will be looked after assiduously.
Example four :
â€œYouâ€™re a good worker; Eleanor;â€ he said. â€œHow long has it been now â€“ eight years?â€
â€œNine;â€ I said.
â€œNine years; and youâ€™ve never had a day off sick; never used all your annual leave. Thatâ€™s dedication; you know. Itâ€™s not easy to find these days.â€
â€œItâ€™s not dedication; â€œ I said. â€œI simply have a very robust constitution and no one to go on holiday with.â€
Yes; itâ€™s quite funny; but now; come on Gail Honeyman; no one is as loopy or brusque or unaware as that. Even Eleanor would know her remark was inappropriate; embarrassing; too much information â€“ even if she meant it to be funny; which she didnâ€™t; because; like any Vulcan; she has no sense of humour. She is the source of the humour but never understands why anyone is laughing. It did occur to me that Eleanor was somewhere on the autism spectrum but that is never alluded to in the novel. Has Gail Honeyman created an Asperger Syndrome character without realising it or is she just playing Eleanor for some pretty easy laughs?
As well as not knowing how real people talk to each other; Eleanor has no knowledge of popular culture. She has not heard of Laurel and Hardy (â€œthe film was about a fat; clever man and a thin; stupid man whoâ€™d joined the Foreign Legion. They were patently unsuited to itâ€) ; and yet she namedrops J D Salinger and the Unabomber. She doesnâ€™t know what parking meters are :
â€œIâ€™ll need to run; Eleanor â€“ the carâ€™s on the meter and you know what those wardens are like if you go a minute over.â€
I had absolutely no idea what she was talking about but I let it pass.
As you see there are some nice comedy moments. Hereâ€™s another favourite : we all know about product placement on tv and in movies. How about reverse-product placement? This is where you aggressively badmouth a specific item quite gratuitously. Eleanor is observing someone elseâ€™s basket of purchases in a supermarket :
Eggs; bacon; orange juice and Nurofen tablets. I had to stop myself from leaning forward and explaining that he was wasting his money â€“ this branded non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug was in fact ibuprofen 200 mg; the generic version of which was readily available for sale at perhaps one-quarter of the price.
For 70% of the time this novel is gentle comedy; of the sort you can find in sitcoms like Not Going Out or The Vicar of Dibley if the Vicar had a brain injury. But then begins the process of Eleanor thawing out and assuming a more â€œnormalâ€ shape. The great thing about this novel now emerges. This novel believes in ordinary human kindness as the thing which can save us; and not romantic love; and that is a great message which is very rarely heard.
But the normalising of Eleanor has some disturbing aspects. Quite often itâ€™s like a rerun of Georgy Girl; the folksy hit by The Seekers from 1966.
Hey there; Georgy girl
Swingin' down the street so fancy-free
Nobody you meet could ever see the loneliness there - inside you
Hey there; Georgy girl
Look at all the boyfriends you donâ€™t get
Never had a real one yet; just look at the clothes you wear
You're always window shopping but never stopping to buy
Just shed those dowdy feathers and fly - a little bit
And the dowdy feathers are indeed shed â€“ cue humorous sketches involving bikini waxes; new hairdos and new clothes. â€œBut Miss Oliphantâ€¦ youâ€™re beautiful!â€ is almost said by at least two characters.
Well. I absolutely donâ€™t want to kick this novel down the cellar steps and have it look back up at me all begrimed with cobwebs and sing ""Where is Love?"" through big blobby tears. I love the gospel of ordinary human kindness here; even though itâ€™s wrapped up in some fairly disgraceful looksism and evangelical therapyspeak towards the end. I argued myself up down and sideways about Eleanor Oliphant and finally copped out with a rueful three stars. This is a nice novel. I should be nice to it.

It took a while; but I fell in love with it. I finished reading it whilst I was at a cafe and realised how much of a trance I was in when I looked up and noticed my surroundings.
This is the story of Eleanor Oliphant; a 30 year old woman who's suffered a lot. The tone of the book is quiet; steady and slowly reveals her life to the reader. You can sense something traumatic has happened; but you're unsure; because Eleanor is unsure. Slowly; it is uncovered; and thus this is the journey we follow.
In between all of that; we look at her life. We're inside her mind and perceive her world the way that she sees it; with humorous and witty observations about pretty much everything that catches her eye. You laugh; but also feel this sense of sadness for her; because she's alone most of the time. But she's fine; or so she thinks.
The story looks at the concept of loneliness extremely well. It hurts to read; but the reality of the matter is; loneliness is not healthy as we all know. This is different to solitude; but the need to connect with another human being is strong and innate in this book; and if not met; can cause damage to ones psyche. It was painful to follow Eleanor on this realisation that she was alone. Has been for most of her life. So how does she fix this? How does she battle the demons that've been buried for so long?
This book is a beautifully; written journey I became fixated on. There's pain; but growth and absolute attachment to Eleanor. I couldn't get enough of it. (less)",114,NEXTBOOK

Eleanor Oliphant is happy. Nothing is missing from her carefully timetabled life. Except; sometimes; everything...
This is a sad and at the same time; strangely enough a fun story. I read a quote on the cover ""A story about the very worst and very best that humans are capable of... Funny; brave and utterly devastating"". That about sums it up. It's a pretty tragic story about Eleanor Oliphant; a lonely peculiar lady with a severely damaged personality due to her past. Literally scarred. A loner; at the office and in her life in general and that's the sad basis of this story. At the same time; the story is quirky; funny; heart warming and tender. I really loved Raymond! The type of guy who is a bit 'underdressed' and 'too good for the world' as we say in Dutch; always helpful and friendly. He isn't put off by Eleanor's slightly weird behaviour and soon becomes a true friend. Loved this character! I've read some of the reviews here; some critical. I can see the points these are making. Still; this book kept me going and going.... Say around 3.8 rating going on 4. A moving story with a twist at the end....and let's say Eleanor learns how to live with a little help... on the way.

Oh Eleanor; I desperately wanted to reach into this story and hug you (even though a hug would be extremely awkward for you) and welcome your quirky self into my life!
Eleanorâ€™s journey took me on a roller coaster ride of emotions. Eleanor is obliviously socially awkward. She had me laughing out loud on one page and then holding back tears while breaking my heart on the next. Eleanor Oliphant is one of the most remarkable characters I have ever â€metâ€™! Eleanorâ€™s inner thoughts (and often her outspoken words) had me giggling throughout every chapter. Her relationship with her mother and memories of her childhood had me cringing and shaking my head in disbelief.
While reading this book; I couldnâ€™t help comparing it to the quirkiness of The Rosie Project which I absolutely loved. I just couldnâ€™t help but smile and melt at Eleanorâ€™s rationalizations for each of her thoughts and actions. She is quite a woman!

I passed on this book when it first came out; but after seeing all the 4 and 5 star ratings from my Goodreads friends I decided to give it a go.
It took a while for me to connect with the story. The first 80-100 pages were slow; and I wasnâ€™t sure if I was loving the rather off-putting protagonist enough to enjoy her tale. Eleanor is a young woman living in Glasgow who suffered a horrifically traumatic event at age 10 and spent the rest of her childhood in one foster home after another and finally in an orphanage. She makes the best of things and decides she is completely fine as a scar-faced independent person with an OK job and her weekend bottles of vodka. Who needs friends and family when you are completely fine without them; right?
Then she unexpectedly finds herself in a situation where she thinks she might like to impress somebody. As practice for this â€œprojectâ€ she begins to expand her horizons just a bit and surprises herself by enjoying these new experiences. And when a normal work colleague doggedly coaxes her into a friendship; it is nothing like she has ever experienced before. That is when the book started reeling me in. After that point; I was totally hooked and read the vast majority of the book in 2 days. Unheard of for me.
Wow; Ms. Honeyman constructed a jewel with this debut effort. Her writing style is beautiful and most appealing. She also drops an interesting new (to me) word every 3 pages or so. I was reading a hardback so kept my online dictionary nearby at all times in order to see exactly what these cool words meant. I love learning new words. She also knew when to inject a dose of humor into this emotive story.
Watching Eleanor learn about all the wonderful human-y things she has been missing in life is profoundly moving. She is like a chrysalis; just waiting to bloom. I appreciated the author not going over the top with Eleanorâ€™s journey; the characters and the story are portrayed very realistically; adding to the brilliance of the book.
I must throw in that I thought the scenes of Eleanor with Maria Temple were particularly well done.
This story is many things. It is both wrenching and full of heart. It is deeply touching. It is dark; yet inspiring. Most of all; it is one of those few books one reads that is truly unforgettable. I highly recommend Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine to all.

So; when I come across the title 'Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine'; I wonder how much of this statement is true; and how much of the evidence for or against this statement I'll notice in one single reading.
Eleanor is odd; and nobody is completely fine in this world; cruelty oblige. Eleanor doesn't notice everything in her life. This is crucial and tragic at the same time. Eleanor has her job and sets her own routine. She is quirky; and humorous; in spite of her efforts to be serene.
What I like about this book is the readily available humor; some of which is uncomfortable. This is strange; since Eleanor's life is set like clockwork. So kudos to the author for setting up this whole rigmarole situation. I consider Eleanor to be quite successful in life. And this book is equally so. I just wish I could explain some things to her.

next; eleanor drove me up the wall. im talking about driving me absolutely bananas. and i am definitely one of those people who if they dont like the character; then the book will be a massive struggle. which was the case here. especially because this story is almost completely character driven. theres not a whole lot going on the with the plot; so what drives most people to finish the book is desperately wanting to know â€what happened to eleanor?â€™ and i did too; but not because i cared about eleanor as a character. only because i have an incessant need to know everything. lol.
overall; i understood the message of the story; and whilst i agree that it was a good one in theory; it didnt personally impact me as much as i would have liked. just too many things got in the way; i suppose. but yay for everyone else who loved this - you all are much more patient and understanding than i am!

ELEANOR OLIPHANT IS COMPLETELY FINE...YEP!...and this FINE DEBUT is going on my favorites shelf for 2017!
There are many...many laughs to be had here...but there is also evil doing.. As you come to know Eleanor and her tedious; but entertaining routines of the day; you will methodically find out about her haunted past; love for vodka AND her forthright personality....to tell it like it is....no matter what the situation!
Without giving anything away; I'll just say that Eleanor deals with her past the only way she knows how; goes after what she THINKS she wants; and experiences quite a few changes in her life at age 30. I also believe she just might be related to Olive Kitteridge and Ove in A Man Called Ove....so if you liked them; you're probably going to enjoy Eleanor too....I did!
My only complaint (again) is the darn book summary that gives too much away! Don't read it!
Can't wait for further offerings from Gail Honeyman....another new favorite author!

*freeze frame*
Yup; thatâ€™s me. Scarlett Dragna; main character of the YA hit Caraval. Youâ€™re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation. If everysinglethingthathappenedinthiswholebook was anything to go by; it was through a combination of pointless lying; constant embarrassment; obsession with Some Guy; a big act of caring about a younger sister despite very little indication of that being true; unrelenting drama about a dumb wedding; repetitive interactions; weird descriptions; gender-based generalizations; and insanely personal info-dumps about emotional happenings from the past.
(insert elegant bow here) And that; my dear friends; is my Scarlett Dragna impression. Thank you. Yes; thank you. Oh; please; stop with the standing ovation! Iâ€™m just like all of you. Except I possess such bitterness and have such a grasp of the future that I wrote a character description at the 25% mark; and god did it hold up.
Yup. You guessed it. I didnâ€™t like my most anticipated book of the year.
https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...
(What a surprise! you probably all chant in unison.)
I almost felt guilty about writing a negative review about this book - because itâ€™s about to be damn negative - but then I remembered itâ€™s THIS BOOKâ€™S FAULT. It marketed its damn self as a young adult The Night Circus. It must take some serious goddamn gonads to look at a masterpiece; essentially magic with a front and back cover; and go; â€œYeah. My book is just like that.â€ Spoiler alert: itâ€™s really; really not.
Oh; God; this review is going to be long. My bullet point list of notes alone is long. And I am putting away fruit snacks like nobodyâ€™s business; so Iâ€™ve got enough sugar in my system to sustain a lengthy burst of anger. Strap in; everybody! (Note from later: I sugar-crashed when I was almost done this review. But it did last me through most of it.)
THE SETTING
All I want is a good setting. All those times I said I just want a good character to love and settle down with; I think - and relish this rare gift of a moment - I think I was wrong. I think I care most about settings. (Hence why books with magnificent settings get five star ratings no matter what.) And thus; it is my curse to eternally pick up every book that is compared to The Night Circus.
This book does not have a good setting. Itâ€™s confusing: everything that seems solid is gone back on later. Nothing is real. That doesnâ€™t lead to a good setting. But Iâ€™ll talk more about the constant; piece of sh*t cop-outs later in this review. It lacks the strong descriptions that a setting literally needs. It doesnâ€™t feel magical at all. (More on that later; too.) But above all; itâ€™s not goddamn GROUNDED.
Haha. That GIF made me feel a little better. Thank you; my favorite person of all time forever; Bo Burnham. Anyway; as I was saying. This. Is. Not. Grounded. In Round 14 of 3947234829 why The Night Circus is better than this book and the latter should never have been compared; TNC takes place in our world. Yeah. The author (presumably) realized 1) maybe we need a little bit of magic! And 2) she couldnâ€™t create one of the greatest settings of all time while also establishing a fantasy world. It would have weakened the whole book.
But Stephanie Garber did NOT make the same choice. Instead; weâ€™re unceremoniously dumped into a world where there are islands and colonizing empires and that CLASSIC YA trope of using clunky terms to differentiate the world from the real one (like Hot Season; because they donâ€™t have WORDS FOR THE SEASONS). Even more fun; during this book characters travel between countries/colonies/islands/empires/I have no idea; and the reader has NO GODDAMN CLUE WHAT IS GOING ON.
Alright; I think Iâ€™ve talked about the setting for too long. I see that now. But this is an UNFORGIVABLE OFFENSE; OK?
THE CHARACTERS
Weâ€™re introduced to a worldâ€™s worth of characters here; and this book achieves quite a feat - they all manage to be either flat; boring; or both! Yaaaaay! Iâ€™m totally ready to try to pretend to feel emotionally connected to these goons for 400 pages!!
First: Scarlett. Cannot believe we were trapped inside the head of the most boring character of all time throughout what was supposed to be a suspenseful thrill ride! (But; obviously; was not.) Sheâ€™s easily embarrassed; obsessed with propriety; falls in pretty much instalove with Julian because heâ€™s hot. Lies all the time because poor widdle gal is embarrassed of something or other about herself. Super weak. Constantly questioning her own reasoning and letting others make decisions for her. Tries to act like sheâ€™s a protective older sister; but; speaking as a protective older sister; she doesnâ€™t give much of a sh*t about family when sheâ€™s staring into Julianâ€™s eyes or literally sucking his fingers.
But then we get into a whole different type of characters: Those who; by the end; we know NOTHING. ABOUT. Tella; Julian; Legend. Weâ€™re given descriptions of them that are gone back on; returned to; and gone back on again. Nothing is real. The whole thing is confusing and an absolute waste of energy. I came SO GODDAMN CLOSE to DNFing this book because it has about 100 twists and none of them make sense. I wanted to shake myself out of a nightmare. What the hell was going on for 400 pages?!
Beyond that; theyâ€™re boring and I donâ€™t want to talk about them. And so were the â€œvillains.â€ Scarlett and Tellaâ€™s dad is literally ruthless for no reason. His wife left him and now he plays psychological games of abuse with his daughters. Thereâ€™s a moment where he essentially tries to get his daughterâ€™s fiancÃ© to rape her. And for what reason? It makes no sense. No sense at all. He slaps a random girl across the face at one point; murders some random dude. I donâ€™t know what excuse to make for that except that this book is sloppy.
THE PLOT
Word to the wise...if you havenâ€™t read this book; you may want to skip this section. Even the stuff I donâ€™t mark as spoilers may be somewhat spoilery. Iâ€™ll try; kind of.
So this book centers on Caraval; the supposedly wonderful setting Iâ€™ve already moped about for way too long. Caraval attracts a bunch - well; an unknown number of people; and is supposed to be a scavenger-hunt-style game. Somehow; though; in spite of the bajillion people who actually give a sh*t competing against her; Scarlett just stumbles into the goddamn clues.
Hereâ€™s my world famous (Iâ€™ve become famous since the beginning of this review; right?) Scarlett impression; coming back to show you what following her through this shindig feels like. â€œOh; this terrible poem-slash-cheat sheet I was unceremoniously given says I have to â€earnâ€™ the next clue! Itâ€™s probably just this thing I randomly picked up along my travels with zero fanfare! Or maybe it has something to do with a situation I just stumbled into! Doesnâ€™t matter which choice I make; somehow itâ€™ll be manipulated into being the right one!â€ Where are the stakes?!
I also feel like 80% of this is just us listening to boring old Scarlett being like; â€œOmg; I think Julian is lying to me. Whatever shall I do?! I donâ€™t trust him!!! I just want to kiss his face off!!!â€ Etc; etc. And despite spending ALL OF HER TIME with him; sheâ€™s never just like:
(view spoiler)
(view spoiler)
And this book is just one cop out after another. Weird choice to write a supposed â€œâ€œâ€œâ€œhigh fantasyâ€â€â€â€ book without wanting to define your world at all! Everything that is said definitively is gone back on; so many conflicting descriptions of Caraval are given that I couldnâ€™t summarize them if I tried; and on top of all that; we donâ€™t even get answers at the Big Reveal.
LANGUAGE
This book is written...weirdly. For one thing; Scarlett; in order to remind us of her special snowflake status; sees emotion in COLOR. It is straight up so annoying. Here are a handful of my least favorite instances; for your reading horror enjoyment.
1. â€œShe could see the sting of her rejection in shades of stormy blue; ghosting over his heart like sad morning mist.""
2. â€œPeriwinkle curiosityâ€ (I donâ€™t know why I hate that one so much. I just really do.)
3. â€œIt would have been a mistake to kiss him; yet she felt â€¦ disappointed. It came in cool shades of forget-me-not blue; which wrapped around her like evening fog; making her feel hidden enough to acknowledge that she wanted to experience more of Caravalâ€™s pleasures than she would ever have admitted out loud.â€
Did you notice anything besides how irritating that quirk is? Numbers 1 and 3 are pretty much the DAMN SAME. What the hell?!
The language in this book isnâ€™t always AWFUL; itâ€™s just...weird. Every sentence is very overwrought. Like; not everything has to have figurative language. Hereâ€™s my favorite example: The worst poem I have ever; ever read is in this book. And Iâ€™m an English major who hates poetry. Would you like to read it?
""This girl was last seen with Legend.
If you catch her; you shall catch him as well.
Of course; you may have to venture through Hell.
But if you succeed you may find yourself rich.
This yearâ€™s winner will be granted one wish.""
I do have to give this book some props; because this is the first time I have ever had to shut a book for 90 seconds in order to hysterically laugh. No one ever told me that the word â€œrichâ€ rhymes with â€œwishâ€! Hahahaha. This poem should be used to teach the importance of using meter.
GENERAL STUPIDITY
I havenâ€™t had the absolute privilege of writing one of these sections in a while! Itâ€™s like a homecoming. An unpleasant; unwanted homecoming. Like if my home was a festering swamp; or a city sewer system.
Hereâ€™s one beautiful example - seriously; itâ€™s like a gift from the reviewing gods: â€œThen she did her best to explain the truth about death and Caraval. Tella didnâ€™t know the particulars as to how it worked. It was one of those things that people didnâ€™t really talk about.â€ See what I mean?! Instead of the author coming up with an actual defined magic system; she just says â€œOh; um...well the character doesnâ€™t know. Thereâ€™s that!â€ The world has no definition and neither does the magic. In other words; some of the sloppiest fantasy Iâ€™ve ever had the privilege to read.
Plus; thereâ€™s a lot of weird stuff going on with hooking up with your family membersâ€™ sloppy seconds. I donâ€™t want to talk about it because Iâ€™m grossed the f*ck out. I just want to let everyone know Iâ€™m SUPER not a fan.
Thereâ€™s also a fun moment where Scarlett lectures her sister on how â€œYou canâ€™t be in love with someone you just met;â€ even though a) she fell in luuurve with Julian in less than 5 days and b) she was planning on marrying someone sheâ€™d never met; and thought she could tell he was a good guy THROUGH LETTERS. So dumb.
And then maybe my favorite moment of all: When a fortune teller tells Scarlett she wants â€œlove and protection;â€ her reaction is even worse than I would have expected from a character I hate. She says; â€œIsnâ€™t that what every girl wants?â€ WHAT. THE. DAMN. HELL. No! No; not every girl; you piece of shit! Itâ€™s fine to want that; but some girls want adventure and knowledge and friendship and bravery and the ability to look out for their damn selves! What the actual f*ck?!
Bottom line: I canâ€™t believe how much I hated this book. (Or how long this review is.) Boring setting; boring characters; boring plot. Overall confusing language and decisions and reveals. I honestly wish I had never read this book. (less)",121,NEXTBOOK
Caraval,(Caraval #1),https://www.goodreads.com/series/169095-caraval,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1465563623l/27883214.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/photo/27883214-caraval,3.94,Stephanie Garber,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14137787.Stephanie_Garber,Fantasy; Young Adult; Romance,Emily May,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1528390751p2/4622890.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,"I feel the same way about Caraval as I did about The Star-Touched Queen last year. In fact; many of my comments are the same; so if you enjoyed that book then it's probable you will like this one also.
Caraval is a fantasy without world-building or significant character development. It relies on its dreamy descriptions; purple prose; and a heavy helping of romance to make it dazzle. To take a quote from my review of The Star-Touched Queen; ""if you buy into these metaphors; put on your prose-tinted glasses and let yourself get drunk on the glittering descriptions; I suppose you might be able to ignore..."" that's literally how I feel about this.
It is about two sisters - Scarlett and Tella - who live on some random island in the middle of random world X with their abusive father who wants to marry Scarlett off to a count she's never met. Caraval is; as it sounds; a carnival-like game on another random island. People go there to play and if they win; they get a wish. The mysterious Caraval master is a guy called Legend; who Scarlett has been writing to for years; but he has now finally replied - and sent three tickets for Scarlett; Tella and Scarlett's fiance. Upon arrival at the island; Tella goes missing and it soon becomes apparent that finding her is all a part of the game. Scarlett must solve the clues and find her sister before Caraval is over.
For one thing; this is a writing style that never appeals to me. So many metaphors and similes that I know are supposed to be evocative and exciting; but they're nonsensical. Phrases like this:
â€œIt smelled like the middle of the nightâ€
â€œHe tasted like midnight and windâ€
â€œTellaâ€™s expression fell; like a doll Scarlett had dropped.â€
I understand that some readers like this kind of mysterious; weird writing; but it just pulls me right out of the story. I'm sat there thinking ""how the hell does something TASTE LIKE MIDNIGHT?"" What does it even mean that Tella's expression fell like a doll that Scarlett dropped? Does it mean that Tella is like a doll being dropped (i.e. unhappy doll?) or is the author equating the downwards turn of her expression with the downwards fall of a doll? Or neither - it just sounds good?
And here; have some more:
â€œSomething about him made her feel perilous shades of silky black.â€
â€œThe world tasted like lies and ashes when Scarlett woke.â€
â€œSomething acidic and moldy and burnt bubbled up through Scarlettâ€™s throat - the taste of death.â€
Letâ€™s forget for a second that death now has a â€œtasteâ€ - is the author just listing random words that sound cool? Think about it. How can something taste acidic AND moldy AND burnt? I just don't believe that good writing is collecting as many exciting; descriptive words as possible and shoving them all together; regardless of whether they make any sense.
But whatever. That's just taste for the writing style. I personally thought the story was lacking too; unless you are seeking more romance and descriptions of male muscles than actual fantasy and mystery. From the very beginning; Scarlett goes on and on about the gorgeous men around her - Julian and Dante - often forgetting that her sister is missing because she is so caught up in her own romantic ambitions. And; of course; when Julian is seen talking with another girl; said girl is described as ""some tart in a bar""; in comparison to Scarlett who blushes every time Julian looks at her.
He had the sort of profile meant for sculptors and painters. Full lips; strong jaw; coal-dark eyes sheltered by thick; dark brows.
Do you think that she means ""sculptures"" and ""paintings"" instead? Or is it a stereotype I don't know about that artists are supposed to have a certain sort of profile? Anyway...
I found so much of this book unsatisfying. I gave it an extra star because it remained interesting enough for me to read to the end; but there's not much more than a flowery romance contained within these pages. The mysteries and reveals are not particularly exciting; and there's a poorly-executed end moment where a character reveals everything through a long speech - like a magician dropping character at the end and telling the audience how they did it.
Also; as a side note - and I wasn't sure if I was going to mention this or not - I got a very strong sense that I had read this story before. Most people probably won't know what I'm talking about. But back when I was about eleven/twelve years old; I read a book called The Forbidden Game by the same author who wrote Vampire Diaries; about a girl who gets pulled into a game and must find her friends before the time is up. There's also a mysterious; gorgeous guy called Julian pulling the strings (holy shit; I was in love with him back then) and this book is so similar. Really. It makes me wonder if the author read it too.

4.5 stars. Iâ€™m very impressed with this book. The most important thing you need to know is that; although itâ€™s marketed as such; it really isnâ€™t a competition per se. I mean; itâ€™s as much a competition as THE NIGHT CIRCUS is.
Sure; itâ€™s a game indeed; a treacherous game that you can lose yourself in at any moment; but itâ€™s not a competition. Iâ€™m not going to elaborate; because Iâ€™d have to reveal some things that will spoil some surprises; so youâ€™ll just have to trust me on that.
But itâ€™s good; so good. It plays with the reader so well. Itâ€™s not only Scarlett who risks her life to win the game; itâ€™s also us; or so I felt. I felt as I were a player myself. Sometimes characters are clueless and donâ€™t see what is in front of them while we readers scream our heads off trying to make them SEE. This never happens in this book. Because whenever Scarlett learns something; we learn it too.
The reader in me canâ€™t help but try to guess what has happened and who that character is and what the characters will face in the future; etc. I just canâ€™t help myself. And so thatâ€™s what I did. But even though I kept trying to have things figured in my mind before the main character ever could; I still ended up being delightfully surprised.
What really shines in this book is the action. Every new chapter brings a new setting or mishap or character: the story progresses well. Sometimes scenes can be lethargic because of an exaggerated amount of description; but that too never happens in CARAVAL.
What stole my heart was the magical; fairytale-esque writing style and narration. Though it obviously is a young adult novel â€“ no cross-genre going on â€“ I didnâ€™t mind that it wasnâ€™t more sexy or ghastly.
Itâ€™s very worth reading if youâ€™re a fan of fantasy novels; uncanny and treacherous stories and thrilling; intelligent plots.

I was intrigued by the summary from the second I found this was coming out; but had no clue if it would live up to the hype. The back cover boasts of â€œThe spell-casting fantasy destined to become a sensationâ€ and Fox 2000 has already purchased the rights to turn this into a major motion film; which claims some pretty mind-blowing story is within the covers. This book was even better than I could have imagined and then some. Hi; my nameâ€™s Chelsea and Iâ€™m addicted to Stephanie Garberâ€™s world of Caraval.
The blurb tells you everything you need to know going in; honestly; the less you know the better and the more confused you feel; the more enjoyable your reading experience will be. Every single chapter had some sort of twist; and whether it was minor or major; it got me. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. This book was somehow 400 pages; but it went by too quickly. I kept saying â€œJust one more chapterâ€ and next thing you know; it was finished. Sort of. Because YAY book #2 is coming! Well; once she writes it of course. (No pressure Steph. Iâ€™m only gnawing my nails to the bloody nub in anticipation.)
Surprisingly; one of my favorite things about this book was the budding romance between Julian and Scarlett. I must be maturing (HAH!) and opening my reading door to some new things; because years ago this would have grossed me out to the core. The good news is it isnâ€™t gross and cheesy; the tension continually grows throughout the book but it is really quite clean. This is something I wouldnâ€™t bat an eye at letting my teenager read; the romance was tastefully done and; while refraining from being cheap and raunchy; sucked the reader in as the relationship grew. IMO; this showed what true talent the author had in being able to gain the readerâ€™s interest in her romantic composition without relying on overdone sexual situations that are graphic and distracting from the heart of the story.
JULIAN. I know Scarlett is supposed to the the show stopper here; but Julian stole the limelight for me. I fell in love with his character from the first page he showed up; heâ€™s rugged; bold; and hilarious while carrying meaningful dialogue and playing a deeper role than just eye candy. I found myself cheering for him constantly throughout the story; and even when suspicion is cast his way multiple times (which both was rightly and wrongly cast); I couldnâ€™t have cared less. This series I believe was set up; not as a complete focus on one character with many supporting roles; but as a character study on multiple people with a more complex story that interweaves multiple interests. While it is told mostly through Scarlettâ€™s POV; we have a view into otherâ€™s interests as well; and the massive cliff hanger on the final page has set this up to be a strong series that should continue without a hitch.
There is an overall dark feel to this book; and there is some disturbing violence in a fantasy-related sense; but it was necessary and intriguing to the story line. The mystery surrounding Legend and his traveling Caraval performers was breathtaking; I found myself completely lost in this otherworld. To me; it had a historical fiction feel with a side of science fiction due to the fantasy aspect; which made for a unique read. Iâ€™m not sure what else to add; other than I have an advanced case of Caraval hangover and need the book #2 cure ASAP. If you enjoy Young Adult novels; regardless of your age; youâ€™ll want to open your heart and your book shelf up to this one. I hate writing reviews this far in advance for a book that doesnâ€™t come out until next year; but go ahead an pre-order; make a note to yourself to request at your library in January; or go to NetGalley and request your copy; because it will have a guaranteed spot on my Top 10 Wrap Up at the end of the year.

4.5 STARS
This book was just absolutely ENCHANTING! I didn't know how high or how low to set my expectations before going into Caraval but one thing is for sure by the time I closed this book: Caraval surpassed all my expectations and more. I've always been a sucker for circus/carnival themed books but I never read another book that came close to one of my favorite circus tales and favorite books of all time; The Night Circus. But Caraval has easily set its place right next to The Night Circus as one of the most magical stories I have ever read.
From the very first page up until the last; there was never a dull moment while reading Caraval. It was just an enigma wrapped in magic and deception. One minute you think you have the story and the characters all figured out; the next minute the storyline takes you on a completely different direction! There were just so many twists; turns; and puzzles that every page leaves you hanging at the edge of your seat.
Although Caraval didn't really feel like it took place in a circus/carnival like I was hoping it would; the world building was still very mystical. Clues and objects are paid in your deepest secrets; greatest fear; or even days of your life. There are tunnels that drive you mad and make you question what is real and what is simply part of the game. Caraval was just full of so many surprises that'll keep you turning the page. I had so many theories right from the very beginning that kept changing and evolving as the story progressed. I was so immersed in trying to crack the big mystery that was Caraval and Legend. Remember that it's just a game. But is it really? ;) This book will definitely leave you with more questions than answers in the end so prepare to be mind blown!
I can't even put into proper words how magical this book truly is. Of course I can't speak for everybody; but I can almost guarantee that you'll never read a story like Caraval! Stephanie Garber has made quite the entrance into this community with this captivating piece of work. I almost can't believe that Caraval is actually her first book! I can see so much potential in this author and in this world that she has created. I definitely can't wait for book two because something tells me that Stephanie has more tricks and magic up her sleeve for her readers! :)

I cannot rave enough guys... this book wins everything.
This has made it in to my absolute all time favorites. I can't even function normally to describe it... I am absolutely floored. Zero complaints. I enjoyed every sentence.. every page.
I couldn't get enough. It was whimsical; off the charts electric; romantic; mysterious; enchanting; enthralling... full of twists and turns. So many that I thought the ending couldn't possibly live up to the mystery this created.. but it absolutely did.
My advice is to go into this knowing NOTHING. Seriously; I wanted to throw like 10 billion quotes in my review because I loved it THAT MUCH but its going to be so much more mysterious if you just dive right in. But I'll say this - I was hooked from the first page. There's a series of letters that Scarlett writes to the 'Caraval master' Legend over a series of years. This story begins when he finally writes back.
I loved the writing and the pacing so so much. It wasn't too slow but it wasn't too fast either - it was just right for the character development. Scarlett was the perfect choice for an MC and I loved being in her mind without any outside perspective. Everything about the plot and the other characters are a complete mystery. Good luck trying to guess everything... you'll need it. The best part of the experience for me personally was trying to guess who was who and who was good/bad.
I literally cannot comment on any of the other characters because it would be a spoiler - but oh man.. you guys. I think I'm in love.
And the end? CLEVER. Wow. I LOVED IT SO MUCH. I thought Stephanie was writing herself into a hole with all the mystery but boy oh boy did she deliver.
The setting is another win for this book. If you like the Night Circus; you'll be pleased. (The plot is totally different but the magical circus/carnival like atmosphere is on point.)
Alright; I know I've done nothing but hyped up this book. Do yourself a favor though- go in with zero expectation; spoilers; hints; etc. Just enjoy the ride.
Now excuse me while I go work on fan art because this has taken over my world.

The setting kind of feels like The Night Circus meets the first Pirates of the Caribbean with a bit of The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus thrown in? The story is completely unique; though; and TOTALLY pulled me in.
Every single element was so well done. The way the whole story unfolds as a sort of mystery + quest with a deadline makes it a million times more addicting; but the characters; writing; and setting would have been incredibly strong on their own no matter what. I have zero complaints.
Every time I thought I had some complaint during the story (like ""do NOT try to make the abusive father sympathetic now"") the story would just twist in a different direction that worked even better. And by 80% I wasn't sure how on earth there would be a sequel but when I got to the epilogue I was like OF COURSE! THIS IS BRILLIANT!
Basically; I was just constantly surprised the whole way through. The plot weaves all over the place and keeps throwing curveballs at you to the point where you don't know who or WHAT to trust anymore. I thought I called some plot twists at the beginning; but was completely off. This is one of those rare books you wish you could forget and then go back to read all over again for the first time because figuring everything out is an adventure on its own.
I also loved how the relationship between the two sisters was the strongest relationship in the story. I mean; there is romance; but it's not the central focus. And I liked that this is a complete story by itself; but then the epilogue has a cliffhanger that leads into a sequel that's already perfectly set up!
Stephanie Garber is an incredibly talented author and this is a book that pretty much any age will love!!

IT'S SO MAGICAL. I totally preordered it and then immediately decided to wait 9 months to read it. I don't know either; mate. This is the life of the Procrastination Queen. Also I saw a lot of disappointed reviews; so I was prepared for teeth gnashing and refurbishing it as a hat if I didn't like it. But I kind of accidentally loved it?? Except for the narrator. I would be like 500% okay if Scarlett fell into a bucket of soup and never got out. BUT NARRATOR ASIDE = wow it was weird and wonderful.
+ The world was actually incredible.
It's like set in this mysterious carnival type island world. So think: gondolas and weird tunnels and magical shops and doors that change directions and rooms that grow and shrink with your emotions. It was like Alice in Wonderland but SINISTER and with a vague circus vibe and like set IN VENICE. Duuuude. I like. I LOVE it when buildings have their opinions though lowkey am curious why that room didn't crush Scarlett because that would've been exciting. BUT OK.
+ The writing was rather beautiful too.
Except for that line where she likened a kiss to ""giving birth to the dawn"" or whatever and I'm like...mate. You do not put BIRTH and KISS in the same thought with a guy you just met. Ya know. Anyway. I really liked all the vivid descriptions! It didn't feel too flowery but just added to the magical vibe. So so much magical vibes.
+ Mind twisty!
They start off the book saying ""nOTHING IS WHAT IT SEEMS"" and Scarlett promptly forgets that 2 seconds later and freaks out over everything. I would like to stuff her in a shoe. But it was really really well done!! I had SO many questions. It tossed me about a LOT. And I questioned everyone adn decided they were all evil by page 3. So basically: I had a freakin good time. I loooove worlds that are so morally grey and all ""IT'S A GAME AND EVERYONE'S GONNA GET STABBED!"" I mean. Monopoly was so yesterday.
+ Okay but real talk: Scarlett...why.
Just why. She was the typical: ""I am a good and wholesome creature."" sort of character who informed us 87 x per chapter that she was GOOD. Aka; super boring. I do think she had good character development; but if a bucket had narrated it would've been just as exciting. Which is weird that I still love the book a LOT even if Scarlett is as stimulating as that plastic fork over yonder?? Nice.
+ SISTER STORY!!
Except Scarlett was boring and Tella was a self-centred ass; but you know what. Family...ya can't pick 'em. And I do love books about sisters; EVEN IF Scarlett did forget for a second she wasn't Elsa and threw out the ""You can't love a boy you just met"" line even though Scarlett was freaking in love with a boy she just met. Apparently we are in Disney now.
+ The romance was honestly super BITTER and I liked it.
Let's have some salt and vinegar on those CHIPS my friends; because Scarlett is Too Holier Than Thouâ„¢ to fall in love with the rougish sailor who I was totally all for 100% of the time. Especially when I thought he was the villain. That would've been a fab plot twist. But whatever. JULIAN. YOU DASTARDLY LITTLE SNAKE. I loved how they fought so much but obviously cared about each other. #shipping
+ A few negatives?
Eh; okay so the ending had a LOT of high stakes things going on but...it was kind of writing so apathetically I wasn't even worried. It was too rushed and the reactions of the characters weren't realistic enough. Also I'm a fussy turnip. Just in case you didn't pick that up yet. I also am frikkin' sick of fantasy being so sexist because there's literally no need in a world that's not attached to ours. STAHP. And there was a LOT of repetition. Irritating ya. But I survived because I'm a champion inside.
ALL IN ALL: Look I thoroughly enjoyed the magical setting and it gave me ALL SORTS OF FANTASY APPRECIATION. No really!! I finished it and thought ""I love this; I genuinely do"" and I want to immediately read more books about Caraval and hopefully find myself a bedroom that expands when I put more books in it because I am heckin' running out of bookshelf room here. Narrator = nope. (Although I loved that it was in 3rd person!) Julian = yes. Creeptastic psycho mysterious Carvanal master = HECK YES. And the world is honestly so inspiring to me I need to eat a cake and sit down for a while.
Every person gets on impossible wish; if the person wants something more than anything; and they can find a bit of magic to help them a long.

That's how it caught my attention in the first place. Was that a publicity stunt? If it was; it's not going to help much because the book is shitty. There is nothing new or exhilarating here. If anything; it's ideas stolen from a bunch of other books; The Lunar Chronicles; Hunger Games; Night Circus and such. There was no originality here whatsoever; on top of all that IT'S BORING AF!
The only characters who held my attention were Iko (TLC much?) and Dante. Obviously; if you are interesting; you aren't good enough for this book. They are no one of relevance. :/
Let's talk about Scarlet; our main character. I really tried to like just because of that name of hers. Scar from Lunar Chronicles is my absolute favorite! Unfortunately; similarities don't go any further than their name. This Scarlet is one of those characters who we are constantly told is clever; adventurous; and ambitious. Let me tell you right now; she is none of those things. Scarlet is gutless and way too naive for my taste. I'm sorry; but i didn't find her to be very intelligent either. Many times i was baffled by her ignorance. These riddles weren't even hard to crack; but it took Miss Scarlet pages and pages crying over totally random and irrelevant things till correct answers would slap her right in the face. THEN things would click in her tiny brain.
Legend is the Darkling figure more like an insult to Darkling's greatness. He is the mysterious host of Caraval. He is dangerous. He is crazy. He is the villain. No one has ever met him; nor do they have any idea what he looks like. He wears a new face every year. And he sees everything. In other words; BLAH BLAH BLAH. At first; i was aboard. I was totally anticipating meeting this Leged. However; at one point his name started irritating me because it's all just talk. He isn't even in the book!
Julian is a young sailor who helped Scarlet and her sister escaped their evil father. He gave me massive Captain Carswell Thorne vibes. Of course; me being trash for TLC didn't need anything more. When i started looking at Julian as his own character; not Carswell wannabe that's pretty much what he was his character is flat/painfully predictable. Didn't buy the romance for a second. It was merely anticlimactic.
This being said; please don't let me discourage you from reading this. What do I know; I am just a crazy woman who is super picky when it comes to fiction. It's just my; once again; unpopular opinion. UGH; i told you didn't out it there for decoration.

HOLY CRAP ON A CRACKER! Loved it! â¤
I guess I should put up the big ole spoiler label just in case I get spoilery!
First off let me just get this off my chest. I wanted to smack Scarlett about 15 times during the book because she said this one thing about 50 billion times.
I have to get back to get married. I have to get back to get married. I have to get back to get married. I have to get back to get married. I have to get back to get married. <-- Okay those are not the EXACT words but still - ya get me?
But I digress =)
The sexual tension between Scarlett and Julian could melt butter! And gave me some twinges at times. Good twinges!
I guess I should just crack on with the book =)
Soooooooooooo; Scarlett and Donatell (Tella) have a jerk face for a father and they are stuck on an island with him. He will do horrible things to them or other people if they dare try to escape. But Scarlett has a way out; she is to marry some dude her father set her up with and take her sister; Tella; with her. Scarlett has never met this man and her father won't tell her anything about him. Like that's not sketchy.
When Scarlett was younger she used to write letters to Master Legend for years trying to get him to come to their island with his Caraval. Of course he never comes but one day many moons later he sends a letter to Scarlett inviting her and Tella and a guest to his Caraval on an island down on the right.
Scarlett is so happy but she knows she won't be able to go because she will be getting married soon but Tella gets her to go. It's an unsavory way but Scarlett; Tella and Julian (whom Tella met while he was visiting their island) all end up at Caraval. And it's crayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy! Things and people are not what they seem.
And they say that Legend creeps around watching people. You also have the choice of watching the show or participating in the show to get a special wish at the end if you are the winner. But the show can drive you mad.
Turns out Tella is put into the show and everyone in the show must find her or she could die! What? Julian decides to help Scarlett out and it's so freaking good!
I'm shutting my mouth and not saying another thing because you need to read it and find yourself in the crazy land of Caraval. I wonder where the next book will take us! =)

I listened to the Audible version of this book and I was mesmerized by the beautiful and vivid imagery that 'Caraval' contained. I was drawn in by the world that Ms. Garber created and it held my attention right to the very end.
Every once in a while; I love a great paranormal romance. I love to leave reality behind and take off on a journey to a place where magic and fairytales exist. This was the perfect story to do just that.
Scarlett; aka ""Crimson""; and her sister Tella have lived under the oppressive rule of their father. His cruelty seems to know no bounds and he takes satisfaction in tormenting his daughters. Knowing how close the girls are to one another; he uses their love against them. When one of his daughters breaks a rule; it is the other one that will receive the punishment.
Awaiting her arranged marriage to a Count that she's never met before; Scarlett is just biding her time until she can get away from her sadistic father. She's literally counting down the weeks until she will be married and can take her sister with her to her new home. Unlike Scarlett; Tella is skeptical of the mysterious fiancÃ© that seems to say all of the right things but whose identity remains shrouded in mystery.
Before Scarlett can be married off; she receives an invitation from Legend; the famous mastermind behind the Caraval. Despite writing to Legend ever since she was a young child; Scarlett has never received a response before. Now; with the clock counting down to her wedding; it seems like fate that she would receive her first ever response and an invitation to participate in the Caraval.
With the support of her sister; Scarlett sets off for the mysterious island where Legend has indicated that the Caraval is taking place. Along with Tella; she sets sail with Julian; a young sailor; to participate in the forbidden game. Both sisters know that they are risking their lives by sneaking off against their father's wishes. However; they are willing to take their chances in order to seize a once in a lifetime opportunity.
From that point forward; the girls are caught up in a magical and dangerous world. Appearances are not what they seem and even time moves differently in this new world. Caraval is a game where the stakes are very high and not everyone will come out alive or unscathed.
I don't want to give anything away or ruin the surprise for others. There were many twists and turns that I didn't see coming while listening to this story. Just when I thought I had everything figured out; something else would happen that made me question everything again. This story held my attention and kept me guessing right to the very end.
If you like adventure/fantasy/paranormal stories with plenty of twists and turns; this is a great choice. There is some romance; but it took a back seat to the magical world of Caraval. For me; the adventure and mystery of Caraval reigned supreme. Of course; there is a love story weaved into this fantastical story as well. Just; don't plan on a super-smutty type of story where the focus on the romance is paramount.
All in all; I thought that this was a wonderful story. I was enchanted by the world that Ms. Garber created and cannot wait to read the next installment. This book filled my head with some beautiful and vibrant imagery that will hang with me for quite some time. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a paranormal/fantasy/adventure to read. It was fantastic! (less)",134,NEXTBOOK

The blurb; the cover; and the excellent reviews promised a magical whirlwind of a story. And this novel delivered that; but its relatively achieved grandeur was overshadowed bit by bit till the end. The last 50 pages or so of the book took its soul out; leaving me with a bittersweet aftertaste; a headache and lots of confusion.
Since I cannot even reflect upon the messy thoughts inside my brain; I'll analyze punctually.
1. The world-building. Sadly; in its true meaning and ramifications; we have no such thing as world-building. I do not even know how to categorize this novel. High-fantasy? Just fantasy? Regardless; in the beginning we had mentions of empires and conquered isles which had me utterly excited; but they were left to rot in the backseat so that the world of Caraval could unravel. Moving to this microcosm; it was indeed complex and fascinating. However; only through its captivating appearance and bold imagery and creative ideas. If you dive deeper; into the background; mechanisms and history; you come up empty. It's all really a facade.
2. The plot. God; the lies. There were so many lies and so many secrets and so many games and manipulation that it honestly ended up being exhausting. Revelations upon revelations; ones that often contradict each other; keep you guessing from start to finish; but after a while this initially mesmerizing stance metamorphoses into the feel of being tricked. Personally; that's how I felt. Deceived. After all the puzzle pieces finally straightforwardly fell into place (some that I've anticipated; some that I did not) you are offered an explanation. And like all good magic tricks; this kills the spirit -- and; implicitly; the so called ""plot"" -- of Caraval. Gone is the magic and wonder; instead; the triviality and over-the-top drama take residence. It's a scam. A ploy. And; much like Scarlett felt in last key-scenes; I also felt I haven't really made progress in the story.
3. The characters. We have Scarlett; our heroine; Julian; the love-interest; Donatella; the sister. Governor Dragna; the father and also the villain. Legend; the pseudo villain and the mastermind behind Caraval. Plus a few secondary; yet admirable characters (them I liked in their entirety). Scarlett could have been awesome; I'm telling you; if it weren't for her constant fretting and worrying and flowery thinking. Her personality was nuanced only in the kind; moral and brave spectrum; but at least a fraction of character development existed. Julian is a completely other story. The hottie and protective type; he was so intricately woven into the scam I've mentioned that he missed becoming a swoony book boyfriend. Tella was; on the other hand; funky and with a mind of her own; but her supposed cleverness the author tries to sell us falls flat. Despite their flaws; the sisters had a nice relationship. Their father represents a villain-wannabe that should only be called as he truly is -- an abuser; a bully. Legend... now Legend was a mystery and I'd love to find out more. The epilogue seems to hint we'll see him again in a sharper focus.
4. The romance. A bit too syrupy and insta-love reminiscing. I realize now it's the same feeling I've had when reading Falling Kingdoms: it's too much; too early in too little pages. About a quarter into the book; the feelings developed by Scarlett for Julian were already getting in the way of the plot. And I am quite the romantic fan girl; so when I'm saying something felt off; I'm not doing it lightly. Taking into account the amount of untruths that they based their relationship on; it's yet again a case of a shaky foundation to a central aspect of the book.
5. The writing style. Expect prose the likes of Laini Taylor. It sounds beautiful and I'll admit I get swept away pretty easily with this type of writing. It felt like the story flowed; despite its numerous hiccups. The third-person narrative also helped induce a darker atmosphere to keep us on the edge. On a structural level; there was redundancy; but I managed to overlook it gradually. Overall; I'll keep an eye out for Stephanie Garber; because this debut certifies she has storytelling skills.
Even though Caraval has been pitched as The Night Circus in different and refreshing clothing; it is far from the lovely and slow-burning tale of Celia and Marco. Nonetheless; I wholeheartedly believe it deserves at least a skimming. It's an enigmatic story from start to finish and the epilogue assured I'll read the sequel. Color me intrigued.

I really did want to like this book.
I really did want to dive into a magical and dark adventure with Scarlett and Tella.
Sadly for me; I didnâ€™t enjoy it the way I thought I would; and this adventure turned out to be a little school trip to Boredom Land; with one heck of a frustrating main character.
And donâ€™t even let me start on her sister.
The premise is good; though it has its little flaws right from the start.
The writing; for one; has a dull and chanting rhythm. There are a few nice quotes here and there; but nothing remarkable. Dialogues and attempted bantering included.
Gosh; those dialogues. *shivers* Iâ€™ll have nightmare for days.
The characters are infuriatingly undefined.
Their personalities and traits are smudgy on their borders. They all read the same way; they all look and talk the same; and they lack of substance; insomuch that; still now; I canâ€™t understand what the deal was with a lot of them.
Scarlett is not that bad; but if I had to tip the scale in favor of a concrete judgment; Iâ€™d say sheâ€™s an easily forgettable character.
Sometimes I found myself wanting to jump into the book; grab her by her shoulders and give her a vigorous shake because; holy crow; her obliviousness got on my nerves more times than I can count.
Sheâ€™s really insecure and timorous; yet patsy and judgy to the point of aversion.
To an extent; I see how her fatherâ€™s abuse has a part in all of this. Yet; as someone whoâ€™s supposed to be the tough and motherly sister; I feel like sheâ€™s way too immature and naÃ¯ve; too ready to give away her feelings to those who donâ€™t deserve it.
Still; Iâ€™m not holding any of this against her; because poor Scarlett is basically an unconsciously willing victim of circumstance.
Tella; on the other handâ€¦
She's so flipping selfish and dumb. I really hope Scarlett will grow some balls and tell her off. Oh; scratch that; just give her a well deserved noogie.
Julian; Mr Love Interest; could not be there and I wouldnâ€™t notice; or wouldnâ€™t care. I probably would have liked him more if he wasnâ€™t always trying so hard. His purposes and aims are so conventionally confined into the â€œtypical mysterious good-looking guyâ€ category; and his flirting is so bland that you canâ€™t even go past the fact that heâ€™s just another pretty face in another unpretty book.
Iâ€™m not even gonna waste my words on Legend and all the *sarcastic air quotes* mystery that surrounds him. Fuck you; you old fart. Give me my money back.
Luckily enough; the plot is probably the thing I liked the most; even if I probably hyped this book too much in my own head to the point it took me exactly 270 pages to feel the readerâ€™s high.
The setting is gorgeous; I got to give it to the author. Had she wrote about flowers and dresses and a whole another kind of circus-like place (one where; supposedly; Scarlett is a badass and Tella is participating in an Erasmus program in Grunland); I would have fallen hard for it.
I wish sheâ€™d focused more on describing the surroundings; giving more space and a proper background story to more secondary characters; instead of going on; pages and pages; about feelings and stuff.
However; I loved the way everything merges together and gives the story; its performers and the entirety of Caraval; this Venetian; carnivalesque freak-show kind of halo.
Alas; things started to get interesting when I was already too far into the book and already too oriented towards a negative outcome; so I probably didnâ€™t even enjoy it as much as I could have.
I kind of was expecting that ending; to be honest.
Itâ€™s the kind of book that requires something shocking; that leaves people with their mouth agape.
Well; it should do so; at least.

I unfortunately was not a big fan of Caraval; which is very disappointing to me considering I was really excited for it!
Pretty much; everything about this book fell short for me. Every character was bland and annoying with no personality. The romance had absolutely no substance in my opinion; I never felt any chemistry or understood why they got together other than the fact that they were basically one of the only people available to the other. The setting of Caraval was so much less magical and whimsical than I anticipated; and even the darker portions of the performance weren't dark enough! The tagline is ""It's all an elaborate performance;"" but it felt nothing like a performance at all. It felt like one big; wishy-washy scavenger hunt; not the *amazing; adventurous* experience we're lead to believe.
The magic system itself really irked me. It felt like a bad case of ""This happens because !*~.- m A g I c -.~*!"" with very little explanation as to how the magic works. I don't feel there were many limitations; and the restrictions that were present weren't all that clear. The magic system was severely underdeveloped in my opinion; which is a big issue for me as a reader.
There definitely were points where I was more interested and entertained by the story (thought those only occurred when I could block out at least a 3 hour uninterrupted period; which is not typical for my audiobook listening) but overall; it was a tough book to get through. I don't often consider putting books down; but there were times when I questioned why I was still listening and contemplated not finishing it.
Ultimately; this book felt very juvenile for me (that is not to say books intended for younger readers are not as good!) but I tend to enjoy more mature YA novels. That being said; I can see why there is so much hype for this book; especially within readers younger than myself. I think younger Emma MIGHT have enjoyed it more; considering I don't look at books the same way I did at 17.
I'm not sure if I'd read book two; I'd have to see how I feel about this story around the time it comes out. But considering I felt Caraval would have fared better as a standalone; it just doesn't seem like this series is for me. (less)",137,NEXTBOOK

I had high expectations and low expectations stepping into Caraval. Everyone who's read it has been gushing over what a masterpiece it is. But then it was also endlessly compared to The Night Circus. Confession: I didn't like The Night Circus; so I was concerned that I just wouldn't be the target reader for Caraval. Within the first few pages; it was clear that I was going to fawn over it.
""Remember; it's only a game...""
Is it just a game? Is any of it real? Like the players; it certainly didn't feel like a game judging by the amount of times my heart rate increased. I loved discovering new clues alongside Scarlett; stumbling into roadblocks; and overcoming seemingly life threatening obstacles. I haven't been swept away in such a carousel of a story in a long time and am delighted I got to experience such an adventure in Caraval.
Stephanie Garber is a beautiful writer. Her sentences strung together so fluidly; painting a fitting picture for the Caraval world she created. Scarlett; Tella; and Julian jumped off the pages straight away. She wrote such a strong opener with well developed; three-dimensional characters; I was sucked in immediately and had no choice but to stay up and read until the small hours of the morning.
The twists were clever and not too over the top; bringing the final chapter to a satisfying conclusion. I believe there is a sequel planned; but I felt a good deal of closure with the ending as it is (but I am definitely going to be first in line to step back into this world!)
Caraval may end up being one of the biggest YA books of 2017. And rightfully so!
Thanks so much to Hodder & Stoughton for giving me a copy to review through NetGalley!

I was skeptical; because I'm pretty much the only person on Goodreads that did not like The Night Circus; but this didn't remind me of The Night Circus at all. Well; at least the 15% I read before I couldn't force myself to read more. I mean; I can see where people would draw the parallels because of the plot; but the writing in this is much more reminiscent of The Raven Boys or Heartless. The prose is the epitome of lyrical; with descriptions that were nothing short of magical; and I devoured it all with a smile on my face.
â€œIt looked like a storybook come to life. She peered down at bright pointy rooftops; moss-covered towers; gingerbread cottages; gleaming gold bridges; blue-brick streets; and bubbling fountains; all lit by candled lamps that hung everywhere; giving an appearance of time that was neither day nor night.â€
Can we talk about how this is Stephanie Garberâ€™s debut novel? I am seriously shocked; because this is not the writing of a new or amateur writer. She has perfected her craft; and made just a really addictive and impressive first story.
God; the writing was so good. The descriptions were perfection. I understand this might not be for everyone; but this world consumed me and I didn't want to leave when I turned the last page. I know this book is about a magical place; but it truly ended up being a magical experience that I'm not going to forget anytime soon.
The plot of this has a perfect thriller tempo; too! Yes; I've been raving about how magical and lyrical this book is; but I have to emphasize that the pace is fast; too! Each chapter holds a new mystery; and I felt so compelled to never put this book down. Caraval truly is a fast and magical journey that I can't help but recommend everyone take!
Caraval is a magical game that is played once a year. Not everyone can go; but the lucky ones are sent tickets; and once they arrive they are able to choose if they'd like to watch the game or actually play the game. Scarlett has been writing to the master of Caraval; Legend; her whole life in hopes to acquire tickets for her and her sister; and after all these years she finally gets a letter back.
And the sibling love in this is so amazing. My brother and I are really close; and there is nothing I wouldn't do for him. Scarlett's devotion to her sister warmed my heart completely and I loved reading about it. Also; seeing them pick each other over boys is my freaking jam.
This book also tackles the hard topic of parental abuse; emotional; mental; and physical. This topic is so important; and doesn't seem to be in much YA; unless it is the center of the story. So many kids grow up being abused; yet; it doesn't become the center of their life. Seeing Scarlett realize she is not the value of her father's rage was beautiful. We need more books that handle this issue; because Uncle Vernon and Harry Potter isn't close to being the epitome of an abusive relationship. Many parents can be manipulative; abusive; terrible; and it isn't the victims fault; ever.
â€œPeople think no one sees all the nasty things they do in the dark. The foul acts they commit; or the lies they tell as part of the game. Caraval takes place at night because you like to watch; and see what people do when they think there are no consequences.â€
This book does border on unreliable narrative though; because as Scarlett is learning the rules of the game and the magic of Caraval; so is the reader. Caraval is a facade; it might be a beautiful facade; but it is still a facade. The reader is never sure if what they are reading is true; and that is because Scarlett never knows if what she is experiencing is true. I loved the mystery factor and thought it worked perfectly; but I can see where others might not like it as much as me.
And the characters and players in this world are so wonderful! Scarlett was my favorite; and I feel like it would be almost impossible not to fall in love with her. Her sister; Tella; has a good heart and her actions were coming from a good place; but she was a little frustrating. Hopefully; in the next book; my love for Scarlett will carry over to Tella. Julian is the other main character you read about; alongside Scarlett. His character was so endearing and I absolutely loved this story-arc and twist(s). Not knowing whether to root and cheer for him or wish him dead was a unique experience to say the least!
I loved this book. I loved it with my whole heart. I read this in one day; I couldn't put it down. This book is the definition of a sensory read. Please give it a try. I understand that not every book is for everyone; but this book is pretty close to perfection; in my eyes. I whole heartedly expect this to show up on my ""Best of 2017"" list; and I cannot wait to get my hands on the sequel.
I'll be honest; between this book and BeyoncÃ© announcing she's having twins; I feel like the world is trying to ease the blow of Donald Trump's next executive order.

there is nothing quite like the amazement and sensational wonder of this book. i just wanted to crawl into the pages and spend the rest of my days enthralled by the enchanting magic of this story. i love stories that make me second guess what i know and think; and this captivated me from the first page. the stakes are high; unseen forces are in play; and the truth of everything is more hidden than the identity of caraval master legend himself. this was truly an experience; one i will want to read again and again.

So how do you pronounce this; exactly?
In my head; I was saying it like Carnival without the n sound. Well; actually; I ended up trying out a few different pronunciations in my head (see example above); and eventually settled on that one...ish. Because; and I don't know if I'm the only one who does this or what; I've noticed that I kind of mumble stuff that I'm not 100% sure how to say.
Yes. In my head. I'll mumble shit in my head.
And you know what? It doesn't really matter; I was just curious.
Moving on!
Ok; this was fun. I'm not one of the screaming/crying fangirls of this thing; but it was a really cool little book.
The premise is complicated; but in a good way.
Scarlett and Tella are sisters living with an extremely abusive father. Tella is the wild child; while Scarlett is the proper one who tries to do the right thing. Both sisters are devoted to each other; though.
Alright; Scarlett's relationship with Tella; and the stuff with their father is what initially drew me into the story. A couple pages and Bam! I'm sucked in; couldn't stop reading!
But then the book takes off in a different direction; and there's also all the weird stuff about some sort of a magic traveling carnival; and some equally odd backstory about the guy who runs it. It was kinda confusing; especially at first!
Like; there doesn't seem to be magic in their world; but this place is magic? And then there's the whole game aspect to it.
I mean; is she at a magical state fair; or is she a contestant on some sort of Alice In Wonderland game show?
It's purposely vague for a reason; though. There are all these little layers of mystery to the story; and it wouldn't work very well if it were spelled out to either the reader or Scarlett.
But the bottom line is that she's got 5 nights to win a game with ambiguous rules in order to supposedly save her sister. Maybe. Because who knows how much of the game is real?
Toss in a sexy sailor with mysterious reasons for helping her; a possible vendetta against her family played out during the game; being stalked by her sadistic father; and a wedding to the man of her hopefully dreams only a few days away?
Well; it makes for a pretty interesting ride.
The ending is nice and tidy; but there's also a teaser at the end that makes me want to see where this story is going.
I'm not normally a fan of trippy stories like this; but this one was an exception. Very different.
And I mean that in a good way.

VIDEO REVIEW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPwq5...
Wow.
I have been seeing this book being praised for months now and finally; I understand where the hype is coming from. Magical and whimsical. This story just flies by and I loved getting deeper into it as the storyline progressed. I'm shocked at the fact Stephanie Garber is a debut author and this is only her first book because it was everything I wanted and more. I CANNOT wait for more from this author because my goodness this is only her first book and I'm already anticipating anything else she comes out with.
SO happy to say the hype was real for me.
If you can't tell I'm trying not to give too much away just because I feel like the less you know the better. This book does a great job at grabbing your attention and taking you through this wonderful book! (less)",144,NEXTBOOK

Scarlett's grandmother told her stories about Legend coming to their island and the life changing show he put on; but Legend doesn't go anywhere twice; and after an accident at one of his shows he stops doing shows for the public. Scarlett and her sister Tella have never left their home island and so seeing Caraval is just a dream for Scarlett. Her last letter to Legend is written around the time of her impending marriage and surprisingly this time she receives an answer. Yet Scarlett doesn't know how her and Tella can manage to get off the island to go to Caraval without their abusive father's wrath coming down on them. Tella meanwhile is plotting a way to escape from their father with a sailor's; Julian; help when she finds out about the tickets and becomes set on bringing Scarlett off the island with her.
I was pretty into the book until about three fourth of the way through. The writing wasn't too bad and I liked the fantasy aspect plus all the action. I was very much into Julian also and he and Scarlett were pretty cute. I just think that the explanation at the end didn't work for me at all. The way things ended up playing out and all the coincidences that piled up through out the book just made it feel messy and not at all well thought out. I was enjoying the idea that everything is a game and the questioning of reality aspect but (view spoiler) all seemed like too much. It didn't seem like all that convoluted back story was necessary to make the book work and it just ruined it for me. Also the explanation for things was pretty iffy and so I just felt turned off by the time I finished. It started off strong but it lost me there towards the end as things got more and more complicated without reason. (less)",145,NEXTBOOK

WARNING: this review will be a rant; there may be unmarked spoilers. This is also a highly unpopular opinion so if you want to come at me telling me I'm wrong or didn't understand the book I will punch you in the nose from how mad this book made me. Also; there is a high amount of swearing; which I usually don't try to put in my reviews but I am so angry. (:
â€œWhatever youâ€™ve heard about Caraval; it doesnâ€™t compare to the reality. Itâ€™s more than just a game or a performance. Itâ€™s the closest youâ€™ll ever find to magic in this world.""
Caraval was a book I knew I'd hate; I wasn't even excited for it. Then shallow me saw the inside cover and had to read it. Even after Caitlin; who I share similar opinions with; was disappointed. Even after it was repeatedly compared to The Night Circus; which I also hated. So; big fuck you to shallow Amber for making me waste my time.
If you haven't read the book and didn't adhere to my warning at the top of this review; I highly recommend you skedaddle because I am about to go into the characters. So; bye; come back if you hate this book.
For a book where the only review I saw that wasn't a five was Caitlin's; the character's were so dumb and one-dimensional. They literally had to state everything that was happening. It was infuriating to read after the ridiculous description we had had to read of almost every item. This book would have been a lot shorter without the unnecessary metaphors for everything. It was tiring.
But; anyway; let's talk about this shit storm of characters.
First; we have the dumb ass; possible whore(not slut shaming just stating it could be a fact); and ninja turtle of a sister. Now; you may be like; 'where did the ninja turtle part come from?' Well; my friends; her name is Donatella.
So; how did I picture this dimwitted sister the whole time?
Much like this:
A giant turtle with a purple eye band.
Then add this gif - because for some reason we were meant to think that Julian and Ninja Turtle had hooked up.
Moving on; we have the oh so romantic kidnapper known as Julian. Now; you may be like 'woah; a kidnapper?! Are we meant to like him?!' Don't worry; his brown muscles will distract from that. Nothing else matters because he has brown muscles and a solid chest.
Have you forgotten he kidnapped the main character (who I am looking forward to shitting on next)? Me neither. The fact he never called Scarlett by her real name; favouring ""Crimson"" instead; really irked me. She corrected him once and left it. I've had people call me Amanda for a year; and I corrected them every single time; so it irked me that Scarlett was that weak of a character she wouldn't stand up for herself.
Now; let's talk about Scarlett. Honestly; the most dim-witted character I have ever read. She was so stupid that it made this book a struggle. Her absolute inability to do anything correctly; the fact she couldn't solve the clues and the fact she was so hopelessly okay with almost everything was infuriating.
Now; you may be waiting for a representation of Scarlett. I got nothing. I basically pictured her as an 'attractive' blob on legs. Oops. Add that to a blushing virgin and you have Scarlett; the girl who could barely look a male character in the eye.
The plot was even worse. When you have a book with the preface of ""it's all a game"" and ""nothing is real""; it's going to be fucking boring when you try to add 6385923759 plot twists at the end that are dumbdumb. Everything about it had me spluttering in anger and sending Caitlin 80 billion messages.
Honestly; I can't even begin to express my utter anger and hatred for this book. It is literally told over a week and somehow there's a fucking love story too. Don't even get me started on that shit. My notes for it are just: ""this is so fucking DUMB"" - exact copy and paste from my notes.
Ugh; I am still so angry about this book; I don't even want to see it if I can't kick it 169238048 kilometres away from me. I also don't even want to get into the Legend shit that happened or the ""oh no you've been fooled"" or whatever the fuck happened.
To make this even better; I just went through my friends ratings and I've rated it the lowest. So; here's for an unpopular opinion. I mean; I didn't even buy into the hype; how am I this disappointed? (less)",146,NEXTBOOK

Update 19.10.17
The story follows two sisters voyage to Isla de los SueÃos; after being invited to attend this years Caraval. Here; a mystery must be solved; but as every participant has been told repeatedly- ItÂ´s only a game!
The story is captivating; drawing the reader in from the very first page. Stephanie Garber has created a lot of fascinating secondary characters and a magical setting; adding her attention to details makes it easy to picture the world of Caraval.
After talking about the book with a goodreads friend; I realised why I didnÂ´t love this book. The plot is great; and I havenÂ´t read anything like it before; but I did have a few problems with the writing and her main character.
Stephanie Garber has a keen eye for details; and spends a lot of time on descriptions; but some of them just felt off to me. Instead of creating a nice flow; they made me halt my reading. First off; the main character sees emotions as colors. This is never explained and I didnÂ´t fully understand the meaning of it?
""She could see the sting of her rejection in shades of stormy blue...""
""â€¦ disappointed. It came in cool shades of forget-me-not blue.""
Second; she used a lot of random similes.
""He tasted like midnight and wind""
""It smelled like the middle of the night""
""The world tasted like lies and ashes..
""..made her feel perilous shades of silky black.""
Because of the short timeline and their location; thereÂ´s not much world building or character development. While reading the first chapter; I thought Scarlett (the main character) would be a smart one. Someone who would weigh her options and make the best decision; but boy was I wrong. She turned out to be so boring and gutless. She spent too much time figuring even the most obvious things out; and let everyone else make decisions for her. We are repeatedly told how great Scarlett is; whilst being proven the opposite; add the ""no-character-development"" and you have a character that pretty much annoyed me throughout the entire book.
I was also a bit disappointed by the ending. There were a lot of plot twists; but after building the suspense for so many chapters; I felt as if she chose the safest way to end things.
(view spoiler)
It also ends with a bunch of unanswered questions and a cliffhanger. (less)",148,NEXTBOOK

3.5 stars
Anytime a book is surrounded in as much hype as CARAVAL; I try to go into reading it with lowered expectations.
BUT.
Said hype seldom stops me from actually reading it. Not b/c I'm a lemming; but b/c curiosity. *shakes fist at curiosity gods* That being said; beyond the pretty; pretty cover and the quote; ""It's only a game;"" I had no prior knowledge of the contents when I first cracked its spine.
The concept is intriguing: two sisters; raised by an abusive father; run away to play a game whose winner will be granted a single wish. That's oversimplification; but I don't want to spoil you; so that's all you get. *orbit gum smile*
The problem is the execution.
A lot of new authors make the mistake of browbeating their readers with key details:
1. Ever since their mother abandoned them; Scarlett has felt responsible for the well-being of her younger sister Tella.
2. Above all things; Scarlett desires escape from her father. But only if the escape provides safety and security.
3. Tella is reckless.
But instead of these ideas being vocalized once; then reinforced by demonstrations; we're simply told (over and over again) by an increasingly fretful and exasperating Scarlett. And once Scarlett gets to her destination; it only gets worse; b/c we know the things she repeatedly tells us are untrue.
Little to no world-building.
The only things we know about Scarlett's world are:
1. It has magic and that magic is a tricksy fae sort of magic.
2. The part of the world that Scarlett and her family live in is conquered (by we-don't-know-who) and travel is restricted. But this information feels more like a plot device to explain Scarlett's inability to travel freely than actual world-building.
Ringmaster's island is more developed; but it felt like a Stardust /Diagon Alley/Disney mashup; so MEH.
Then there's other weird stuff like how Scarlett assigns colors to emotions; an obvious sign of her own magical ability; which is never addressed. We just get a lot of very specific shades that mean very specific things (sometimes nonsensically); except for when the colors don't mean anything at all . . . But are still very specific; which is confusing and a little bit weird.
Cerulean blue . . . Apricot orange . . . Saffron yellow . . . Primrose pink. OR if you're familiar with my peeves; blue blue; orange orange; yellow yellow; and pink pink. *flares nostrils*
BUT.
By the end; I had either grown immune to Scarlett's fretting or she'd calmed down--I can't be sure which--and I wasn't quite as annoyed by her as I'd been for the first three-quarters of the book; which allowed me to appreciate the ingenuity of the tale.
SO.
Although I don't think CARAVAL by Stephanie Garber comes close to living up to the hype; I don't regret reading it; and I'll probably read the next book. Garber is clearly capable of dreaming up not-your-ordinary-story; she just needs a bit of polish. Recommended. Ish.

Albeit some minor character flaws; and mildly predictable occurrences.
""Welcome; welcome to Caraval! The grandest show on land or by sea. Inside youâ€™ll experience more wonders than most people see in a lifetime. You can sip magic from a cup and buy dreams in a bottle. But before you fully enter into our world; you must remember itâ€™s all a game.""
Nice way to begin; isn't it? This book was like those drinks where you sip fantasy and breathe imagination. This book had bits and pieces that resemble 'The Night Circus'. It wasn't that the two books were similar; not really; but there was a connection like a world of magic; entertainment; and games that exists only within certain borders. I read the synopsis to caraval somewhere in 2015 way before it's publication date. I know they say never judge a book by its cover; I guess if you count the synopsis being on the cover as being counted; then I'm guilty as charged. But the idea was so intriguing; a place of magic and wonder and danger; where reality twists and turns; and even better; it's been the dreamland of an isolated island girl who has never left home? How could you not want to read it?!
""The future knows what things we desire; unless there is something greater in our path that chases us away.""
I think I loved this quote so much I would have tattooed it on my heart; too bad I'm middle eastern and don't have a death wish. The book was melodic and beautiful; it had a poetic rhythm to it once they entered the caraval. It was a gorgeous creation of fantasy and a wonderful setting; and oh how I loved Julian! Perhaps he was the best part of the book.
""She imagined loving him would feel like falling in love with darkness; frightening and consuming yet utterly beautiful when the stars came out.""
Oh yes; that is exactly how you could feel about Julian!!!
Scarlett and Donatella had a beautiful sibling dynamic; the protectiveness they tend to develop when they are left to fend for themselves. Oh and who doesn't absolutely love the added touch of an abusively powerful father and absent mother. While this book had all the elements to create the perfect heroine; this is where it came up short. Between perfectly placed opportunities; scarlet could have been the ideal character; abused but strong; loving yet untrusting of the world; and ultimately surprising. But she just wasn't. I mean yes I did like her; but I could have loved her you see. Between being indecisive and uncertain; she seemed to keep emphasizing a very false sense of caution. I mean if you were so worried about your sister getting lost in the caraval; why whisp away time playing into their hands. I mean yes; if a person is only mildly concerned; they will fret and then go on about whatever they were doing; but when you suspect her life may be in danger; wouldn't you be tearing the world in two to find them?
I think mainly Scarlett's bravery seemed slightly more exaggerated than the reality of her actions. She wasn't the heroine I usually adore; but I did like her very much though.

(Heads up: my Goodreads review is spoiler free but hopefully later this week I'll be posting my spoiler-filled and probably way too long video review to my YouTube channel: youtube.com/emmmabooks)
Lord of Shadows is the sequel we've all been waiting for. It has the same amount of high-intensity; beautifully constructed; and deep; yet comedic content we love to see from The Shadowhunter Chronicles . Lord of Shadows delves deeper into the Shadowhunter World than we've ever seen before. From the repercussions of the Cold Peace; the rising tensions between Downworlders and Shadowhunters; to the nuclear bombs waiting to detonate between character relationships; everything about this series expands into a bigger and better tale than I could have anticipated. I had so many theories going into this book and while some were confirmed; some were *basically* correct; others were thoroughly off but the execution was much greater than anything I could have imagined. Anything I could have asked for was either delivered as I wanted; or something I didn't even know I wanted until it was given to me.
I loved that we were able to get more perspective from a variety of other characters (Kit; Ty; Livvy; Dru; & Diana). While I feel every character in this series has grown from book one to two; it really was a pleasure to learn more about this specific set of characters and get to know them better. We do also get four cameos from TMI characters which I was TOTALLY satisfied with and happy to see. But I do specifically feel that Emma; Julian; Mark; and Cristina have done more maturing than most. I just feel that with all the burdens each of them carry; they begin to face them head-on; which made me very proud. I think any reader who loves the TDA characters will be impressed with the character development in the sequel!
As per usual; the plot of the next installment of The Shadowhunter Chronicles is insane. I love how effortlessly the stories of TMI; TID; even a bit of TLH; and somethings I can allude to for TWP are implemented into the present series. I loved all of the different journeys our protagonists went on; From London; to Cornwall; to Faerieland; to Idris; there's so much adventure and excitement to love. Of course; within that comes all of the devastation which no one is prepared for; but still flawlessly written; nonetheless.
As always; I have to applaud Cassie for continuing to grow and improve her craft. I truly believe every single book in The Shadowhunter Chronicles gets better and better as the story deepens. I'm particularly impressed because I saw risks with Lord of Shadows that weren't always taken in past books and I stand by all decisions made (yes; even each of the deaths!) I'm satisfied; elated; heart-broken; and blown away all in one.
Of course; I'd highly recommend reading Lord of Shadows. I cannot wait for you all to experience this story!

by Oblivion's Dream on tumblr I ADORE this Emma art!
I ..... I am shocked to be saying this but; THIS is my favourite Cassandra Clare series. I'm sorry Infernal Devices; IM SORRY. (but also not really this series is so good) Like; if you tear out the final pages of this book it's nearly perfect and Lady Midnight IS perfect.
LORD OF SHADOWS IN GENERAL
I don't think I loved lord of shadows as much as I loved Lady Midnight but I still really really enjoyed it. I absolutely adore the characters in this series; especially Emma; Julian; Cristina; Livvy; Kit and Ty so having them all back in Lord of Shadows was of course a highlight.
I just love how COMPLEX these characters are. Every single one has so many dichotomies and intricacies that make them fascinating. I think in Julian; especially; that is showcased; but also in Mark; Cristina and Emma too.
The way the plot moved from location to location; featuring the Faerie Realms; London; Alicante and LA was fun for me; I liked how the story moved around more then it did in Lady Midnight.
There was also so many moments that left me genuinely shocked and I read this entire book at maximum speed because so much of it left me having to know what happens IMMEDIATELY. I know heaps of people find Cassandra Clare boring; but I personally find her books really addictive; and I want to know what happens straight away. You know the old 'take a peek at the end of the chapter because what the fuck is happening' trick? me in every chapter of her books.
â€œKit thought about Emma with her sword; Emma saving his life; Emma hugging Cristina and looking at Julian like he hung the moonâ€
Lord of Shadows feels much more mature then Lady Midnight and I think that is a real strength of this book. Lord of Shadows definitely critically examined the world we live in today through the lens of the shadow world; and much of the discussion and plot point was very on-point for current events. That did show a maturity in Cassandra Clare's writing; and I do definitely think this is her most political and developed book (and series).
Representation was also fairly good for a Cassandra Clare book. Mark and Kieran are bisexual; Diana is a black transwoman; Cristina; Jaimie and Diego are all Mexican. Ty is autistic and heavily implied to be gay; and Kit is heavily implied to be bisexual. Dru is fat.
Aline (gay; chinese); Helen (bisexual) and Jem (chinese); Alec (gay) and Magnus (biracial and bisexual) also appear but are only in it for a very short time.
I DID HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH BISEXUAL REPRESENTATION WHICH YOU CAN READ ON MY TWITTER THREAD
I didn't like Lord of Shadows as much as Lady Midnight because of some of the characters and the plot points and I'll get into that below. But it's still such a fucking solid book I really loved reading it.
CHARACTERS
EMMA: Honestly; y'all who hate Emma can get off my fucking lawn I love her SO MUCH. She's brave; smart; loyal; loving; protective; caring. She cares so much about the Blackthorns and her parents and she wants to be loved back so much in return; and I just really need her to be happy and okay. I love her strength and resilience so much. She's definitely my favourite character I love her. (view spoiler)
JULIAN: HE SCARES ME BUT I LOVE HIM. He's so soft with the kids even though he's NOT SOFT IN GENERAL and his character is really interesting because there is this dichotomy between the soft; loving parent he is for the kids; and then the hard; callous shadowhunter he has the potential to be and often exhibits. I'm really; really excited to see where his character arc is taken in Queen of Air and Darkness because the ending of LOS has left him in a position to swing in an extreme direction. JULIAN JUST LOVES THOSE KIDS SO MUCH AND HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR THEM AND LOVES THEM SO MUCH AND IT MAKES ME EMO. !!!!
MARK: I have to admit... I don't love Mark as much as everyone else but he's okay. I was really wanting to see some good character growth from him but ... I'm a little iffy on him. This I'm gonna get into.
CRISTINA: Cristina is such a GREAT CHARACTER. I love her relationship with Emma and her growth as a character and how she's become part of the family. I liked the exploration of her past with Jaimie and Diego. BUT; I found her plotline with Mark/Kieran really annoying.
KIT; TY AND LIVVY: I absolutely loved this trio. They definitely added a new dynamic that wasn't there in Lady Midnight. Each is such a fun character; though Kit was my favourite because I loved his humour; and how his mundane culture clashed with the shadowhunter culture in both positive and negative ways. (view spoiler)
DRU: Dru is a character I really want to like; and can really see myself liking in the future; but I found her arc a little awkward and boring. I did like her arc concerning her self-image and her role amongst the blackthorns; and I'm excited to see more from her in The Wicked Powers
ZARA DEARBOTH: god .... (view spoiler)
ROMANCE
Right; the main issue I had with Lord of Shadows was the oversaturation of romance and make out scenes. WE GET IT; EVERYONE IS SUPER HOT.
Lets start with Kieran .......
His relationship with Mark is Unhealthy And Needs To Be Discontinued Immediately
- forgetting what you did doesn't excuse what you did
- sending ...... someone ...... dreams ................... it wasn't .... cute
- remember when he manipulated Mark many many times
- like not... spill the tea. but.... people need to shot shipping them just because they're two hot guys because Kierat really isn't a NICE GUY
- im salty
The drama with Kieran/Mark/Cristina was ANNOYING; it was annoying. And literally all the ""I looked at him and immediately had to make out with him"" IM EXHAUSTED. No one has this much sexual chemistry and tension in real life nO ONE
Emma and Jules are NOT free of this because they were also bad; though I don't think they are AS BAD but fgfj still STOP KISSING AND START SOLVING YOUR MANY ABUNDANT ISSUES.
There was so many make out steamy scenes I actually got bored of steamy make out scenes.
Kitty and Kitliv is excused from this mess they are all Pure.
by Oblivion's Dream on tumblr
PLOT
I found the first 100 pages kind of underwhelming not gonna lie. But after that it got way way better. Enjoyed the Mark/Emma dynamic; and their genuine friendship that came from it. Really liked the trip into Faerie; and what we saw from Julian and Emma there.
LOVED the scenes in London; and all the references to the TID characters; as well as the appearance of tmi/tid characters. Was super cool to see Magnus and Alec as dads.
MY TOP 5 SCENES
(view spoiler)
â€œSometimes the most ruthless heart speaks the most truthâ€
Lord of Shadows is an absolute monster of a book; and there is so much to talk about. This small review barely even covers the surface of my feelings about this book. I truly adore all the characters so much; I have so much genuine concern over their happiness.
The plot really picked up and I am DYING for Queen of Air and Darkness. I can't believe we have to wait until 2019. (view spoiler)
There is so much going on in these books; and so many little arcs that accompany the larger one; but the books are so fun and definitely Cassandra's strongest works character; plot and writing wise. I have always been willing to criticise her work; but I do think she worked on some of those criticisms in this series. Its much; much stronger then tmi AND tid in my opinion.
I AM NOT OKAY WITH THE ENDING. I don't think it's possible to be okay with that ending.

My reaction after finishing Lord of Shadows
I've had it with love triangles! I'm usually up for them as long as my ship prevails in the end ;) but man did Cassie complicate things for every possible pairing in this book.
Emma/Julian/Mark - I thought this triangle wasn't so bad after I was done with Lady Midnight cause I knew Emma and Julian couldn't be romantically involved but Cassie effed things up with E&J always finding ways to hold each other and kiss. It was like saying you hate your ex and then getting back together the next day.
Kieran/Mark/Christina/Diego - this triangle was the weirdest of them all cause I had a feeling like they wouldn't mind a 3way (minus Diego who's cancelled)
Livvy/Kit/Ty - erm... Is Cassie setting up Kit and Ty for a parabatai bond? Or are they going to date? I'm still not sure. I'm very much looking forward to witnessing the parabatai ceremony since I have no idea how that actually happens. Note: I've only read the first 4 TMI books; not the full series. I actually found out in LoS Clary and Simon are parabatai. Now I'm like 0_o
TID>TMI
Triangle drama overshadowed everything else and I ended up disappointed cause Clare went for cheap tricks and chaos. Tsk; tsk! And to think this book is over 700 pages long. (less)",157,NEXTBOOK

The writing has improved SO much and the characters here are my absolute favorites. And... I cannot believe I'm saying this; but I actually liked Jace and Clary.
But just like with Lady Midnight; I was more into the actual characters than whatever the larger plot arc was. I guess I don't care that much about Malcom; Annabel; the book; the Shadow Lord; or most of that drama. Pretty sure anything (or nothing) could be happening and I'd be just as entertained because THESE PRECIOUS CHARACTERS are all so wonderful and I adore them so much.
Cassandra Clare really is the queen of love triangles and forbidden romance; though (which hasn't always worked for me in the past). And even if the angst did get a bit excessive at times; I still rolled my eyes affectionately instead of in any sort of annoyance... because I actually CARE about everyone. Ughhh that ending wrecked me.
I don't want to get into any of the plot or spoil anything; so I'll just say it was really fun to see Faerie; London; familiar old faces; and get to know the current characters better. One of them turns out to be transgender and I thought it was handled really well (but will defer to others who can say whether that's the case). I just love how much wonderful rep these stories have!
I really do love every single character; but Ty is seriously one of my all-time favorites from any book. I'm still so thrilled to see such a caring; badass; complex kid who happens to be autistic. It's not his whole personality; nor is it something the story tries to shy away from or handle any differently. It's approached so matter-of-factly that I just want to hug the book. And Kit's relationship with Ty is amazing... I ship them as friends or a couple or whatever. I don't care. I just love them together so much.
And I know I'm not spending time here gushing over Emma & Julian or Mark & Cristina & Kieran but the feels are still there.
I also really admired how the plot managed to weave in obvious parallels for current social issues in a way that felt authentic instead of like some message beating you over the head. There's a fascist Cohort faction of the council that supports the Downworlder registry; believes they speak for a silent majority; and
""seek to return the Clave to a lost golden age. A time that never was; when Downworlders knew their place and Nephilim ruled in harmony. In truth; the past was a violent time; when Downworlders suffered and those Nephilim who possessed compassion and empathy were tormented and punished along with them.""
""When a decision like [the Cold Peace] is made by a government; it emboldens those who are already prejudiced to speak their deepest thoughts of hate. They assume they are simply brave enough to say what everyone really thinks.""
So that was one of the stronger parts of the plot. And I also love how much mythology and clever references are woven into these stories. Even the totally unintentional ones... like the Mirror of Galadriel scene. Ha. But for real; I had a lot of fun with this book and just wish we didn't have to wait so long for the next one!

Break it in pieces. I give you permission.â€
I don't recall giving my permission though. I don't recall allowing Cassandra Clare to wreck havoc on my soul and stomp on its pieces before scattering them to the wind. But she did it anyway.
â€œA dark time is coming for Shadowhunters. A terrible time. Their power will be crushed; their might thrown down into the dirt; and their blood will run like water through the riverbeds of the world.â€
Blood; ashes and despair. That's the perfect way to describe Lord of Shadows; with its somber ambience and the unease that keeps creeping up from the pages and sinking into your pores. A war is coming. A war more devastating than ever; since the numbers of the Shadowhunters are alarmingly low and they're torn by inner disputes. There is a rising faction that wishes to strip Downworlders of their rights. To treat them like animals. There is a dangerous book of dark; unholy magic that can unravel the world of the Angel's descendants. There is the Unseelie King who wishes to unite the fairie and destroy everything that stands in his way. A girl raised from the dead; with betrayal in her heart and huge distrust towards the people she can call family. The Blackthorns. It all leads back to them and their allies. Relationships are tested. Unlikely friendships blossom. And two parabatai who love each other more than they should; with a love that threatens to tear their family apart. Can some sacred bonds be broken?
â€œThere is truth in stories;â€ said Arthur. â€œThere is truth in one of your paintings; boy or in a sunset or a couplet from Homer. Fiction is truth; even if it is not a fact. If you believe only in facts and forget stories; your brain will live; but your heart will die.â€
There is always something mystical in the way Cassandra Clare writes. While her writing skills keep improving; the essence of her novels remains the same. In Lord of Shadows; she weaves a story of yearning; passion; bitterness; anger and desire. Desire painted with fevered touches and swollen lips and cheekbones illuminated by moonlight and hearts clenching with unspoken feelings. Her descriptions are lavish; her battle scenes intense; and her characters gloriously flawed. From the land of Fairie and unhallowed churches to Idris and the London Institute that sparked a strong pang of nostalgia she whispered stories of cursed love; of injustice and bloodshed and fanatism. And she triumphantly proved that Arthur Blackthorn could not be wiser: despite the pain and the hopelessness; without fiction our hearts would be dead.
â€œThose who cannot love do not understand it.â€
When it comes to Emma Carstairs; Lord of Shadows could easily be renamed into Lady of Bad Decisions. Yes I do admire her fierceness and her strong spirit; her compassion and her sassiness; but by the Angel I lost count of the times she hurt Julian ""for his own good""; when she thought she was self-sacrificing and noble but then mourned her relationship with him when she was the one who broke it. Who broke him. And don't get me started on all those moments when she acted before thinking and ended up endangering everyone close to her. And Julian; well; he also troubled me; especially because he scared me. He was ruthless and cunning for the sake of his family; I can't blame him for that (in fact I love him for that) but if he proceeds with his plan to do you-know-what; I will never forgive him. All this scheming ended up bringing sorrow and huge; fat tears that have not dried yet.
â€œThere were valuable first editions of books in the enormous library; most of them had been scribbled in by some idiot named Will H.â€
All those references to Will and the Infernal Devices (scones! Jessamine! the Lightwood mansion - I was almost certain the Demon Pox song would make an appearance) were a sweet torture; tiny daggers piercing my heart but also mending it because I somehow felt closer to Will; my favorite character of the Shadowhunters universe. Kit; Livvy; Ty; I loved their scenes and crime-solving attempts; they were such an endearing and bizarre threesome! And speaking of bizarre threesomes; I don't know what to make of the Mark/Cristina/Kieran situation. So many tangled emotions that felt right; despite their oddity; I'm still not certain what I want for them; only more scenes; with unexpected tenderness and craving.
â€œThe wound is the place where the Light enters you.â€
The wound the ending inflicted though will not be easy to heal; nor does it feel like a source of light. More likely a source of infinite pain. It was cruel; unfair; and absolutely devastating. No dates slaying frost giants; not even Raziel himself dancing salsa will be able to make amends; my dear Cassandra. I'm off to deal with everything the only way I know.

I loved the book! I loved it so much I found myself rereading certain passages just because I couldn't help myself but had to experience them again and again. =)
Cassie has always been one of my favourite authors and the more I read from her; the more I get captured in her world. Itâ€™s not just the world of the Shadowhunters though; itâ€™s the entire package Cassandra Clare is giving to us. There were so many details and things I loved about this book and even though I will never have the time to list them all; Iâ€™m still going to try to write a proper review.
First of all I have to say that I love the world Cassandra Clare has built and even though it sometimes seems to be more than just cruel (â€œSed lex dura lexâ€) it never fails to captivate me. Well; truth be told most of the time itâ€™s even this kind of harshness that makes it so interesting; the obstacles and problems every single one of the Blackthorns has to overcome making the entire story line even more intoxicating and exciting. Thinking about it in retrospective the plot isnâ€™t even that amazing and if I had to pinpoint why I still loved every line of the book; I would say that itâ€™s the details and the love I found in every single word.
If you donâ€™t like spoilers you should stop to read now; if youâ€™re a sucker for spoilers: please feel free to continue! ;-P
Love; I think thatâ€™s actually the word that sums it up. There is love everywhere and all of the characters have plenty of it to give. There are Julian and Emma who try to fight their feelings; there are Ty and Kit who slowly but steadily seem to fall in love and there is the love triangle between Mark; Kieran and Cristina that left me almost breathless and broken. God I canâ€™t even say how much I loved all of those relationships! I had to laugh; I had to cry; I wanted to tear the book apart and throw it against a wall. The ending literally killed me and even though I finished the book about a month ago Iâ€™m still far from being over it. Cassie how dare you to make such an ending!?!? I canâ€™t wait to read the next book and the mere thought to wait two years is already enough to leave me in anguish! How could you do this to your follow readers?!?!?!
Well; enough of the ranting and back to the good stuff! Relationships are definitely something Cassandra Clare truly excels at and the more I read from her; the better her books seem to become. Itâ€™s obvious that she put a lot of effort into her characters and their world and the little hints at some of the other books never cease to amuse me.
â€œThere were valuable first editions of books in the enormous library; most of them had been scribbled in by some idiot named Will H.â€
Just to mention one of them. ;-P
So yes; since I liked the love relationships the most Iâ€™m going to get into detail now:
Emma & Julian:
I adore Julian; I really do! He has the soul of an artist and heâ€™s so complex that I canâ€™t help but have to love him for it. I never met another character that was so driven by his love for his family; the fact he would do everything in order to protect his loved ones something that sometimes even gave me the chills. He is neither black nor white and his love for Emma only seems to emphasise his inner conflict. The tension between those two is almost tangible in the air and whenever I read about them I was reduced to a squealing fan girl. I really hope that they manage to find a way to break their parabatai bond and I donâ€™t even want think about what will happen now that Livvy diedâ€¦
â€œWhy all these paintings of you? Because I'm an artist; Emma. These pictures are my heart. And if my heart was a canvas; every square inch of it would be painted over with you.â€ â€“ Julian Blackthorn
Ty and Kit:
I love; love; love and love those two!! Every time they interacted I had a smile on my face and felt oddly peaceful. Ty is such a gentle boy and Kit understands him so well. Itâ€™s so obvious that the two of them care about each other deeply and even though Cassie is careful never to give us a palpable proof of their love; I was still able to read it in every single line. I liked all the parts that were from Kitâ€™s POV and since heâ€™s a Herondale I automatically loved him! *lol* I really hope there is going to be more of those two in the next book and I canâ€™t even say how much I ship them! =)
â€œHe let the shirt fall and grabbed a Tupperware container of cookies out of the fridge. Maybe he could frustrate the Shadowhunters by refusing to work out and sitting around eating carbs. I defy you; Shadowhunters; he thought; thumbing the top off the container and popping a cookie in his mouth. I mock you with my sugar cravings.â€ â€“ Kit Herondale
â€œHe grinned; and the grin changed his face completely. Ty when he was still and expressionless had an intensity that fascinated Kit; when he was smiling; he was extraordinary.â€ Kit about Ty
Mark/Cristina and Kieran:
Oh my god! I donâ€™t even know how I should put their love triangle into words! I guess first of all I have to say that Iâ€™m usually no fan of love triangles and donâ€™t like them because they always seem to be so cheesy and tedious. This time however I wanted them to be together so badly that it almost hurt! XD I can understand why Christina is kind of falling for both of them and even though I initially shipped Mark and Kieran in LM I have to admit that Iâ€™m all on the new ship right now! Of all the three of them I somehow loved Kieran the most and therefore truly hope that Mark will be able to forgive him for what heâ€™s done. Since Kieran was taken to the Scholomance at the end of the book I donâ€™t know how their love triangle is going to work out; I certainly hope that I will read a lot of them in the next book though!!! XD
â€œI do not love you as I love Cristina. I love you as I love you;â€ said Mark. He bent his head. â€œI wish that you could see my heart. Then you would understand.â€
I probably could go on and on about all the other awesome couples and their relationships! Druâ€™s friendship with Jaime; Diana and Gwyn (I loved how Gwyn reacted to her outing!!!); Jace and Clary; Alec and Magnus; they all were so awesome! For the sake of the poor person that actually decided to read through this review Iâ€™m going to end it now though! ;-P
All told I relished and loved every single moment of this book and I really; really; really would appreciate it if Cassandra Clare would write just a little bit faster! *LOL* (less)",160,NEXTBOOK

I thought I'd start off the review with like a really emotionally charged sentence of passionate and triumph but ya know what? I CNA'T WRITE THIS REVIEW. I CAN'T. I AM A BROKEN PIECE OF RUIN.
Lady Midnight
IT WAS SO SO SO GOOD.
*wild sobbing*
NOTE: There will be no spoilers for LoS in this review! Or they'll be tagged! Do not fret! However there will be mild spoilers for Lady Midnight; so loooook away now. Ye have been warned.
+ I AM ABSOLUTELY DYING. IT WAS JUST THAT GOOD.
I'm absolute Shadowhunter trash; fyi; in case it was hard to tell. So every book is basically perfection; but I think the Lady Midnight series has just taken it up a notch. I can't eeeeeven with how beautiful and diverse and thoughtful and poignant it all is. The humour is A+ and I snort laugh so hard my dog gets offended and leaves the room. And some of the lines just make my heart melt with how perfect they are. It's like the Shadowhunter world understands so so much??? Like what it is to be different. Or struggling. Or lost someone. Or confused. Or filled with so much love it hurts. I JUST. CAN'T. EVEN. IT'S JSUT THAT GOOD.
+ As far as sequels goes? This was immense perfection.
No second book blues here!! I mean; actually yes. But the only thing that is blue is ME. In the FACE. From SCREAMING.
I do think it had a bit of a slow lagging bit around 70% but when the characters are people I 10000% adore; I didn't even mind??!??? Give me all the lowkey scenes as well as the action ones.
+ Plot? DUH YOU KNOW I LOVE IT.
I can't even with how many subplots that fit in allllll together. Like how on EARTH Are there so many Shadowhunter books but everything fits and works and foreshadows (HAR HAR I'M PUNNY) so beautifully and tightly?!?
My favourite plot aspect was soooo totally the Faeries. I LOVE THE FREAKING FAERIES. They're deliciously evil and terrifying and basically my favourite versions of faeries I've read. Also the description for their culture and looks and everything is amazing. A sky full of jewels? Like sure; just let my heart gallop out of my chest for appreciation for the description.
+ And I will NEVER stop cheering with appreciation for the Autism rep!!
Peoples; it is not only thoughtful and complex; it is so so accurate. SO SO ACCURATE. Ty is so precious and I just love how carefully Cassandra Clare weaves in how different his brain is wired and his habits and tics. It's perfect.
Also when Kit appears and is like ""Oh Ty's Autistic"" and Julian is like ""say what"" is so precious. <3 It just is the BEST how Julian will do anything for Ty and will help him any way he needs and will not hesitate to get more information; even if it's ""Mundane"" information and he's technically not supposed to have it. AFJDKSAFLDFJK.
Also Ty's interest in Sherlock is the best.
+ Okay so let's talk about the characters?!? WHAT WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR.
I'm just gonna flail. For 900000 years. Let's be real here:
â€¢ Julian: is so so Slytherin in this book it's kind of scary and I love it.
â€¢ Emma: I think she has some secret badass magic powers that no one knows about yet?!? I suspect. And I actually appreciated how the book wasn't JUST focused on them so much this time too. And Emma's sass and sarcasm levels GIVE ME LIFE.
â€¢ Mark: MARK IS MY PRECIOUS CHILD AND MY FAVOURITE AND MARK MARK MARK HE IS THE REASON I LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH MY ULTIMATE FAVOURITE CHARACTER NO I WILL NOT USE PUNCTUATION I WILL JUST SHOUT HOW MUCH I LOVE MARK. Although I aggressively ship him na Kieran. Just saying.
â€¢ Kieran: Who is a Slytherin also and I love him and I know he's messed up and viciously faerie and all that but HE'S PRECIOUS AND I LOVE HIS HAIR.
â€¢ Cristina: I like her! She's sweet and kind ... but she's really really perfectly sweet and kind. So kinda boring.
â€¢ Ty: I mean OBVIOUSLY you know I love Ty and his ASD rep is spot on. I also love how he and Livvy got to have more action scenes. Because remember how Clary and Jace were ONLY 15 TOO when they destroyed the world?! Let the babies out!!
â€¢ Livvy: I do wish she had more time on the page doing stuff. She's so sweet and protective of Ty but I don't erally know her personality?
â€¢ Dru: same with Dru. IDK.
â€¢ Kit: OKAY MR. CHRISTOPHER HERONDALE IS MY FAVOURITE. He is soooo a mini-Jace! He's also a huge thief; adorable; hugely sarcastic; loves to get into a fight if needed; and super sweetly lovely to Ty. And just the fact that he does his best to cater to Ty's needs and be there for him is just afkdlsafdjkl. #ship
â€¢ Magnus: is here in a burst of glitter and narcissism and I love him. Also love how Alec and the kids are in here! Also love that one of his baby's is blue and therefore probably also the child of Lazlo Strange. Excuse me.
â€¢ Zara: I wish to would fall off a cliff.
â€¢ Perfect Diego: he can join Zara on the cliff.
â€¢Annabel: Is terrifying; dead; and excellent. <3 She has such severe PTSD and I kind of hate her but also think she needs to be protected.
â€¢ Arthur: Why (view spoiler)
â€¢ Diana: I LOVED finding out Diana's backstory! Although lowkey think her romance with Gwyn was kind of boring/distracting from MY PRECIOUS BLACKTHORN BOYS.
....yeah; um; okay I'll stop gushing over characters. If you insist.
+ ROMANCE.
Okay so obviously Julian x Emma are an AMAZING ship of angst. And I appreciate that their level of angst didn't swallow the book. I hate hate hate the love triangle with Mark x Kieran x Cristina. Mostly because i FREAKING LOVE MARK X KIEREN and Cristina is boring. I also think Cristina only likes Mark because he's a fearie and she's obsessed with faeries?!? So that's not fair?!? I'm soooo glad Kieran features more in this one.
+ Cliffhanger?? Haha...you didn't want...to be calm...ever again...did you.
JFAKDLFAJDSKLJ AKLFSJDAKL JFKDASL THE CLIFFHANGER AJDKFLASDJFAKLDJ.
WHY ARE WE NOT GETTING THE 3RD BOOK FOR 2 YEARS WHAT IS THIS MADNESS. WHATEVER DID WE DO TO DESERVE THIS.
+ SPOILERS ABOUT THE ENDING:
(view spoiler)
+ Perfect book is perfect.
There is no other word for it.
Help.
I am so wildly in love with this series.
***** QUOTES *****
Mark had a smile that could break your heart. It seemed to take up his whole face and brighten his eyes; firing the blue and gold from inside.
""A strange evening; forsooth;"" he said.
""Don't you forsooth me.""
""You really think that's such a good idea?"" Kit said. ""I mean; your house is pretty screwed up; what with your agoraphobic uncle and your weird brother.""
Julian's hands tightened on the wheel; but the onyl thing he said was; ""Ty isn't weird.""
""I meant Mark;"" said Kit. There was an odd pause. ""Ty isn't weird;"" Kit added. ""He's just autistic."" (pg. 63)
""Did you find something?""
""Have you ever wanted a really close-up look at a gross tentacle?"" Emma asked.
""No;"" said Cristina.
""No one ever seems to say yes to that question.""
Maybe he could frustrate the Shadowhunters by refusing to work out and sitting around eating carbs. I defy you; Shadowhunters; he thought; thumbing the top off the container and popping a cookie in his mouth. I mock you with my sugar cravings.
""Morning is probably in just a few hours. And if we don't have Energy runes; we'll have to get our energy the old-fashioned way.""
Mark looked puzzled. ""Drugs?""
""Chocolate;"" Emma said. ""I brought chocolate. Mark; where do you even come up with these things.""
""Who would ever want movies or TV when there are books?"" said Ty with disdain.
#preach
""Magnus Bane;"" said Barnabas; with clear loathing. ""The Ultimate Traitor.""
""Not my favourite nickname;"" Magnus said; gently wriggling his fingers in Barnabas's direction. ""I prefer 'Our Lord and Master' or maybe 'Unambiguously the Hottest'.""
Kit didn't say anything -- he rarely complained. Mark suspected he was silently plotting to get even instead; possibly with everyone he'd ever met.
""I am so ready to hunt down those tiny adorable creatures and give them what for;"" said Emma. ""SO READY.""
""Emma...""
""I may even tie bows on their heads.""
""WE have to interrogate them.""
""Can I get a selfie with one of them first?""
""Eat your toast; Emma.""
""Lex malla; lex nulla;"" said Julian with a regretful wave of his hand. It was the Blackthorn family motto: A bad law is no law.
""I wonder what other family mottoes there are;"" Emma mused. ""Do you know any?""
""The Lightwood family motto is 'We mean well'.""
""Very funny.""
Julian looked over at her. ""No; really; it actually is.""
""Seriously? So what's the Herondale family motto? 'Chiseled but angsty'?""
HE shrugged. ""'If you don't know what your last name is; it's probably Herondale'?""
Emma burst out laughing. ""What about Carstairs?"" she asked; tapping Cortana. ""'We have a sword'? 'Blunt instruments are for losers'?""
""Morgernstern;"" offered Julian. ""'When in doubt; start a war'?""
""How about 'Has even one of us ever been good; like ever; seriously'?""
""Why don't you just throw the sandwich?""
She looked horrified. ""And give up the tasty cheese? I would never; ever give up the tasty cheese.""
""I had never realised before how much you can take from someone by not allowing them the words they need to describe themselves. How can you know there are other people like you; when you've never had a name to call yourself?""
Emma set down her fork with a clang. ""Pretentious hair prince is right.""
Kieran blinked. ""What did you call me?""
""I'm trying it out;"" Emma said; with a wave. ""And I said you were right. Enjoy it; because I doubt I'll say it again.""

I knew you would not survive the Lord of Shadows' tricks without aid.""
Lord of Shadows you get ALL of the stars!
Spoiler free review; although I do mention bits that I like that don't give away the storyline. If you haven't read Lady Midnight I'd suggest you don't read this :)
I have eagerly anticipated this book since I finished Lady Midnight and it honestly didn't let me down what so ever. I had the best two girls to buddy Read with Sailor and Fathima Thank you both for putting up with me! I don't think I could of done this alone!
Just a pre-warning; I absolutely love anything Shadowhunter related; they're my favourite type of books and Cassandra Clare is my favourite author; so I will more than likely be gushing away. I don't know what it is; but the characters are SO detailed; and charming it's hard not to love them.
I'm going to have to include my favourite quote from the book here; it's too beautiful not to include:
""Do you know why I'm sure? Because when this universe was born; when it blasted into existence in fire and glory; everything that would ever exist was created. Our souls are made of that fire and glory; everything that would ever exist was created. Our souls are made of that fire and glory; of the atoms of it; the fragments of stars. Everyone's are; but I believe ours; yours and mine; are made from the dust of the same star. That's why we've been drawn to each other like magnets; all our lives. All the pieces of us belong together."" - Julian Blackthorn
Coming into this; I'd kind of prepared myself for my heart to just break over and over; what I didn't expect was to cry so much at the teeny tiny little things! My heart broke for Julian and Emma; the whole family; Christina and Kieran. These characters are just so close to my heart! The character development in this book was just outstanding.
""They stood in a line: the Shadowhunters; the warlock and the faerie prince.""
""The way I love you is fundamental to me; Emma. It's who I am. No matter how far we are from each other."" - Julian Blackthorn
Where do I even begin with Emma and Julian? During my buddy reads; this was brought up so much! Do you know when you want a pair to be together so much; but it jus doesn't look like it's ever going to happen? Here we have it! We'll always be parabatai; Emma. It's for life. - Julian Blackthorn What makes them special is that they're both quite strong characters; but for completely different reasons. All I want to do is gush about how lovable Julian is. I mean come on; this guy will do anything; literally anything to protect his family. Even in his darkest times he always puts others before himself. What really moves me about Julian is that even though he is hurting he wants to put others happiness before his own. My heart hasn't broken this much over a character since my love Will Herondale. Emma on the other hand; at times I just wanted to shake her and to confess all to not only Julian but to Mark as well! I understand where she is coming from; but you know! Anyway other than that; I'm looking forward to her character development for The Queen of Air and Darkness. I mean come on; for those who have read this; we know!
""In Faerie; I would challenge Rosales to a duel for this; he broke his promise; and a love-promise at that. He would meet me in combat if Cristina consented to let me be her champion."" - Mark Blackthorn
Even now I'm still very very confused with Mark; Cristina and Kieran. Now don't get me wrong; I love them all; but what on earth is happening?! Do they all like each other; is it going to be just two of them together in the end? I DON'T KNOW! What I do know is that I actually really; really; really enjoyed all three of these characters throughout. What I like so much; is that they all contrast from each other and it's all very odd; but so good! We have Cristina who is just a nice girl trying to do what's right. What I really liked is that we got to see her inner child; especially when it comes to Faeries. Something Cristina said was so beautiful I had to include it; so here it is: ""Love is as strong as death. I believe that."" Mark who is such a lovable odd person you can't ever be mad at him. I mean come on! Just the things he says; and how he acts; but doesn't understand why they may be odd to others. Then we have Kieran; the Faerie who gives off the impression he is superior to all; but really just wants to be loved and accepted. It's hard to keep up with these three but they all brought something different. My highlight for Kieran was 100% him bowing and winking when he was called a traitor; it was glorious. I think the dancing scene was so special; and so unique I was just sat there like is this really happening? It was just so perfect! I can't wait to read more!
There's nobody else I'd rather be like than you; I Want you to be proud of me."" - Livvy Blackthorn
Livvy; Sherlock and Watson Ty and Kit once again; I have no idea what so ever what is going on with this trio. I just loved the friendship/relationship which was built between these. I think in this book in particularly you could see them developing into their shadowhunting roles and I honestly found it so enjoyable. (Did anyone notice that when Kit held the Serpah blade; it seemed to glow brighter and brighter; or is this just me). I am beyond curious to find out what is going on with Ty and Kit; are they just very close friends orrrrr?! I love how they're all so close; and if one's in danger the others come to each others aid to help each other out. Seriously though; the standout for me was definitely the promising friendship of Ty and Kit AKA; Watson and Sherlock! Kit is just so understanding; can I put him in my pocket please?
But he knew he could reassure her. He wasn't leaving the Shadowhunters. He wasn't going anywhere. Because where the Blackthorns were; was his home now.
Diana and Gwyn. I think I may have a slight soft spot for Gwyn. Don't ask me why; I couldn't tell you; but I do! This pair are SO good together; I mean they help each other out; they respect one another. Gwyn is so understanding and doesn't even seem to bat an eye. I really really loved Diana opening up to Gwyn; and that made me respect these two so much more. I LOVE THEM OKAY!
They wanted their revenge; The Council. They didn't see how revenge begets more revenge. ""For they sow the wind; and they shall reap the whirlwind"""" - Magnus Bane
We got more of Magnus and Alec wooooo! Most people love Magnus; and I'm no exception. I was so happy how involved these two were in the book; I liked the glimpses we got into their life now; how they've developed and the children are so damn cute!
Finally; I'm hoping we see more of Dru; you know who and Tavvy in the final series of the book; we get glimpses into them; but I really want more...
I have conflicting views about The Centurions; lets be honest Zara is a complete bitch; as his her following. But I think that there's going to be more to it with the others. I'm intrigued to find out more and find out more about Perfect Diego
This part was going into the bits I liked but I think it needs a special mention. Can I just say how HAPPY I am that there were so many connections to previous books; and a lot of that was for The Infernal Devices! When I say this; I mean it. I literally cried of happiness. We got so many beautiful moments.There were valuable first editions of books in the enormous library; most of them had been scribbled in by some idiot named Will H. Photographs of them all together; Jessamine popping up. I-A-M-R-U-I-N-E-D. Not only that but we had Bridget as well! I was hoping for her morbid tunes; instead we got a hilarious line: ""The Herondales have always been famous for their good looks; but if you ask me; the Lightwoods are the more sexually charismatic of the bunch.""
What I liked ahm loved
- Mark wanting to be Cristinas champion; I was crying with laughter. I don't know why; it honestly really made me laugh.
- I really enjoyed that we got to see something from Arthurs point of view; I think he's such an interesting character and was quite surprised we got a glance of something from him. P.S -
""Tell Julian thank you"" - Arthur Blackthorn MY HEART! Not only that; but when he protected Ty and Livvy; it was such a proud moment.
- Chapter 11 was very very veryyyyyy good
- The development of Kit and him coming to terms he's a Shadowhunter; not just a Shadowhunter but a Herondale. When he took up the Serpah for first time I was like YASSSS! Then an Iratze YASSSSS AGAIN!
- The trades the four make to get into the Courts; I liked the fact they each gave something; and they were also told something in return. Each one of these were so perfect!
- All of the secrets. There's so many questions I want answering.
- Ty in the Shadow Market gave me life! I was cheering him on!
- The way in which something is told is so heartbreaking; I don't want to go into too much detail because of spoilers... but I just think it was handled very well.
- THE RIDERS! I'm intrigued okay...
- THAT LETTER! I was in tears; it was so special and so beautiful. Broke me.
What didn't I like?
- The only thing that I don't like is the length of the chapters (for anyone that noticed and read my updates) I can't stop part way through a chapter; and these are sooooooo long!
- Out of 29 chapters; there was only (for me personally) one chapter that seemed to be nonsense and not a lot really happened.
- I really wanted more Jem and Tessa!
WHO IS ASH?! Me and Sailor think he's ""the weapon"" for The Queen of Air and Darkness The excitement is real!
Why do we have to wait TWO years! That ending ripped my heart out and just was like; see you in two years!
""After all; when you are dying of thirst; it was the sip of water you dreamed about; not the whole reservoir.""
P.S - I don't think I'll ever be okay with that ending. Heartbroken.
""I never thought what we had could break so easily."" - Julian Blackthorn

i think it's official to say that i now feel very differently about cassandra clare's books than i did a few months ago.
i just.......... don't know how to put my feelings into words. if you want to take a look inside my current state of mind: Â§""%Â§%""(/=Â§)$=Â§?$?$??$)/=Â§$(IUEDÂ§HUOGKWUDZ
there you go. that's my brain.
there's one thing i want to say though; and this is coming from a self-proclaimed (former) hater of cassandra clare: her books are so full of positive representation of all kind and i'm so; so happy about that. so much diversity in a fantasy series. i am in awe.

Meaning I liked it; didn't love it like everyone else in the world! Damn it all!
I was pretty excited for this book to come out. The love triangles in the books get on my nerves so I wasn't drop everything and lets read it now. I just wanted to get through it at one point.
I love Kit's character. I think he's funny and coming into his own at being a Shadowhunter.
I loved that Jace and Clary made another appearance; but I'm worried at one of the things that was told in confidence about a death. It just about broke my heart and I'm wondering if that will come up in the next book a million years from now.
There is something dreadful that happened at the end of the book and I don't even know what to say. It's sad; okay?
I just wish that Emma and Mark could be together. That's who I WANT! I'm tired of reading about Kieran; Mark and Christina. I love all three characters but I want to see Kieran with Christina because the times they were together there seemed to be something there. Something almost sexy and hidden.
Emma and Julian; I just don't. I love Julian for all he does for the family but I just don't find him as a person that stokes my fire. <-- yeah; I said that.
I love the things that Kit; Ty and Livvy got up to together with the exception of the bad things.
I hated that Centurion; Zara; with a passion. I wanted to drop kick her off the roof. The Centurion's had a plan set up and it wasn't a good plan. Not all wanted to go along with it so there's that.
Arthur is still nuts but he did some cool things and you just have to love him no matter what.
Diana was awesome and stepped up and put that Zara in her place and did whatever she could to save the kids.
Magnus and Alec made an appearance as well. I always love Magnus so he can make an appearance at all times =)
There's a little bit of fighting and things that need to be taken care of and some evilness; but I felt like it was more about all of these people and their triangles. I just don't know. Maybe I will read both books over again when the other one comes out in a million years from now.
I'm still really sad about that ending. I thought it was going to be a different sad ending but it wasn't and it took me by surprise and it's not a good thing =(
and we have a

I want to die. Everything hurts. I can't breathe. The world is over and I have to wait two years. My soul burns. I honestly didn't expect this. This book is a blessing and my hell. Someone save me.
Cassandra Clare is my queen and has quite literally ripped my heart out of my body and stomped all over it.
My lactose intolerance doesn't agree with this book either; I ate two blocks of chocolate stressing out and now I'm banning myself from buying chocolate because boy do I want to cry some more.
It's been like nine hours and I'm still crying. H E L P. This was truly better than Lady Midnight and I never thought I'd say that. Now someone hold me for the next two years.
UPDATE 14/05/17: PEOPLE ARE GETTING ARCS AND IM LAYING ON MY BATHROOM FLOOR CRYING BECAUSE LIFE ISNT FAIR AND I NEED THIS BOOK MORE THAN I NEED A BURRITO (aka very badly)
EDIT: so many people are salty about this cover but guys anything trumps the original TMI covers - especially the first where it's just a chest. So; we've come a long way.
THE COVER HAS BEEN RELEASED. I AM SHOOK. I CAN'T. I LOVE IT.

Why is the London bridge in it?!
DOES THIS SIGNIFY MORE JEM AND TESSA?! OMG. MAY CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH.

Splayed her fingers over his heart. It beat against her palm; like a fist punching its way through his sternum. â€œBreak my heart;â€ he said. â€œBreak it in pieces. I give you permission.â€â€
The hardest part of reading this book is you have to put up with an emotional influx; from what Clare always tangles the love of the main characters like Jace and Clary; or Jem and Tessa and Will; I am certain that Julian and Emma will break you even more like no one can. Lord of Shadows represents a continuation after what happened in Lady Midnight. The plot was developed. The characters grow up. The villains show theirs other sides appealing for our sympathy; yet Cassandra Clare put this together impeccably.
â€œEveryone is afraid of something. We fear things because we value them. We fear losing people because we love them. We fear dying because we value being alive. Don't wish you didn't fear anything. All that would mean is that you didn't feel anything.â€
Julian is my beloved character since City of Heavenly Fire. I could see that his heart was so pure then; and his love for Emma is larger than life. My heart literally and figuratively broke for him when he longs for something he's not supposed to have. Emma; on the other hand; is a great and strong female character. She complements the good sides of Julian; while he gradually unravels his dark side to us in this book. The contrast is surreal and makes this book more intriguing than I thought.
â€œEmma. I need you; always; always think about you; I was wishing you were with me in that goddamned attic and then I turned around and you were there; like you heard me; like you're always there when I need you ...â€
The main plot is moving forward with the slow pace. To be honest; it took me almost a week to finish this book for some parts were boring and some were not. Not like Lady Midnight; Lord of Shadows doesn't have the mysterious atmosphere or thrilling investigation that I fell in love with. I really missed that excitement when I first read Lady Midnight while reading this book; and I hoped that the ending would save it all; but um; I thought I was wrong.
The ending was so cruel and left a major impact on me; though. How could you; Clare ? How could you do this to me ? I'd prepared for anything; ANYTHING. But this ? This is too much. Shockingly I had to stop reading for a while since it hurt me so much to continue even though there were just two or three pages left.
â€œThere's never going to be anyone else for me. That's just how it is.â€
Well; I kinda like how the author wrote about Bangkok institute and transgender. In Bangkok; transgender or ladyboys are very famous; and when I saw this; I was so surprised because yeah ! this is my country and she detailed it pretty good. However; this series has the variety of sexuality from straight; gay; bi to pansexual. And this makes me love Clare even more. I love LGBTQ in novels. They should be paid attention to both in books and real life.
About Ty and Kit; I think I saw something passing between them.
I am so afraid to read this. Not because someone I love might die; but the next and the last book will be released in 2019.

Also can someone come pick up the broken pieces of my soul for me?
Thanks
*Major Cliffhanger warning!* Quite possibly the worse cliffhanger I have ever read. Clare ends this book at the height of major action without having resolved any of the storyline yet ... and now I have to wait till 2019 for the conclusion. I'm a little irked by this actually!
Nevertheless ... I'll add this book to the list of books that now own my soul.

Lord of Shadows left me feeling deceased.
Lord of Shadows was one of my most-anticipated releases of 2017 and i was worried. aside from the obvious fact of PAIN and WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MY FAVES; i was afraid this installment would disappoint me. the more i read and review novels; the more critical and cynical i get. i rarely enjoy books for the sake of it unless there are low expectations. but with Lord of Shadows; i couldnâ€™t help but have high expectations. thankfully; cassandra clare left me feeling happily horrible. it had all the emotional pain and frustration i expected â€“ and more! buuuut there were a few things i was feeling :// about.
this bible-sized novel was slower than anticipated. i remember flying through Lady Midnight despite its size; i can't say the same for LoS. i'm not saying i couldn't bring myself to finish; but there were parts when i thought CAN WE MOVE ON. there were also parts when i anticipated things before it happened. i'm not sure if clare intentionally made things somewhat predictable orrrr if i'm getting better at guessing things. either way; i was kinda sad/frustrated about that.
â€œEveryone is afraid of something. We fear things because we value them. We fear losing people because we love them. We fear dying because we value being alive. Don't wish you didn't fear anything. All that would mean is that you didn't feel anything.â€
aside from these two tiny things; LORD OF SHADOWS WAS AMAZING. it left me feeling wrecked and emotionally unstable. i know some may hesitate on picking this up due to its size; but it's worth every page. i'd highly highly recommend to anyone who likes reading. as someone who wasn't a fan of cassandra clare from the start; i must admit: her work continues to improve and grow beyond my expectations. GO READ IT.
SPOILER-FILLED DISCUSSION BEGINNING. don't say i didn't warn you... *side eye* if you haven't read this book; please please stop here. you DON'T want to be spoiled.
characters & relationships
let's talk about these characters and such first; shall we? ten pages into the book and MARK AND EMMA ARE A THING. i'm feeling every kind of betrayal. i'm screaming my head off. however; it becomes quickly clear that those two are not going to work out (romantically) and the world is right again. (yes; i'm gonna be THAT petty about them.) we all knew they weren't going to get anything more than a platonic relationship. meanwhile; my poor jules is SUFFERING i'm mostly just glad jules and emma are back together-ish?? the truth is out and that's all that matters. sorta.
moving onto the new unholy trinity: ty; livvy; and kit. these three!! are so gold!!! kit starts off as someone who is NOT having it and tries to deny everything about being a shadowhunter. ty and livvy eventually grow on him and he becomes part of their crewâ„¢. THEY ARE MY FAVES. FAVES. FAVES. i kinda ship ty and kit very much and i find it hilarious that livvy kissed kit. the love between these three are so wonderful. until livvy.... I HAVE WORDS ON THIS LATER
the mark/cristina/kieran triangle thing is strange. (diego is not part of this because it DOES NOT EVEN COUNT.) this triangle can go three ways but i'm ultimately rooting for mark and cristina as a romantic relationship. i'm surprised by how much i love cristina and kieran as friends. I JUST LOVE CRISTINA.
now for the other relationships: gwyn and diana? LOVE THEM. they are hilarious and adorable. gwyn was so unexpected and I LOVE HIM. also i LOVE how we found out more on dianaâ€™s past and who she really is! i was sososososo surprised the thing leading up to her secret was that sheâ€™s transgender. (more on this later) dru and jamie have this thing going on and i don't know how to feel about it. :/ in general; the blackthorns are my favorite family and everyone is wonderful. i love the way their family mends together.
plot????!
can we have an in-depth rant about zara and her bigotry gang? they need to GET OUT. as if we don't get enough of this in real life (at least in america right now); it's going on in the shadowhunter world too. WHICH MAKES IT ALL THE MORE RELEVANT. it all started when her annoying ass barged into the LA Institute with her stupid pin; asking the blackthorns to do her laundry. she started off as someone who was simply ANNOYING but eventually became a larger threat. i feel like that's such a strong metaphor for trump's america. it made me realize how politics in the shadowhunter world are very similar to the united states right now. i see downworlders/shadowhunters/faeries/etc as a metaphor for race. the dearborns and the rest of the gang are basically petitioning for extermination and containment of downworlders (aka POC in the real world). i donâ€™t know about you but doesnâ€™t that sound a little familiar???????? people of the lgbtq+ community arenâ€™t entirely accepted in the shadowhunter world; even though there are many who do support them. unfortunately; i think the same could be said for the world right now. itâ€™s weird how i saw these things more clearly after reading LoS â€“ a story set in a fictional world. even though itâ€™s not â€œrealâ€ and the issues are more exaggerated; i think itâ€™s more prominent because I FEEL SO MUCH FOR THESE CHARACTERS. itâ€™s a personal attack on them; which makes it a personal attack on me. it feels real to me â€“ even more so than the â€œreal world.â€ (i think that shows how UTTERLY BIZARRE american politics are right not because it feels like a poorly written fictional story than Real Things!)
anyway; enough of that. i'm just going to get more upset if i think about it. MOVING ON. i was super wary during their trip to the unseelie and seelie courts because FAERIES AND THEIR TRICKERY. it was a hot mess; but i expected worse so *whew.* the part that had me screaming in frustration was when emma was unable to kill the faerie because he looked like her dad. :((( the one good thing that came out of that trip was julian finding out how to break the parabatai bond.
SO. the parabatai bond. it can be broken but itâ€™ll also break all parabatai bonds. this was another ASDJGYFHKLJH;K;WHAT moment. (and also robert is dead so someone HELP)
i didnâ€™t realize the strength of cortana and how important it was when emma killed one of the riders of mannanan. it happened and i was like; â€œoh; okay; moving on.â€ BUT THEN; turns out itâ€™s a big deal and now the riders are probably going after emma in the future. iâ€™m curious (and scared but also not because itâ€™s EMMA) to see how thatâ€™ll come to play in the next book.
annabel blackthorn is a nutcase and should be dead. AGAIN. even though malcom died; i had a theory heâ€™d be back â€“ and he did come back; only to die on by the hand of his lover. (go annabel!) after julian talked to her; i was a little more trusting. maybe she wasnâ€™t that insane. BUT THEN. she goes ham and kills robert lightwood and livvy blackthorn. in her defense; she mightâ€™ve been triggered by the mortal sword and gone to a bad place. BUT STILL. iâ€™ll never forgive her or trust her again.
ENDING???!?!!!
that being said; LIVVY. yeah; robertâ€™s death was sad but more importantlyâ€¦ LIVVY. i kid you not; i read the sentence â€“ â€œ... she was truly beautiful; a Shadowhunter in full flowering glory; just before she landed lightly on the wooden floor diasâ€™s edge and drove her jagged; broken half blade into Livvyâ€™s heart.â€ â€“ and shut the book. i let out the longest gasp and could not believe it because this is not happening this is not happening thisisnothappening.
the stages of grief are true. it started with pure and utter shock; turned to despair (crying for a good 30 min); and now iâ€™m at denial. even though the last sentence confirms it because the clock chimed and livvy was just talking about that clock. BUT. but. robert lightwood also died and iâ€™m hoping it was chiming for robert. (the cliffhanger of LM was a misunderstanding so this could be too???) (nope; cassandra clare is just cruel sometimes)

I will actually admit that; sadly; I did not like Emma and Julianâ€™s dynamicâ€¦ quite as much in this book. I think the tension between them read;; just a little dragged out in the wrong ways? I think this tension actually would have felt more interesting had Emma come close to confessing her feelings in book one; but not actually done so. Here; I just felt like the arc of their dynamic from book one was simply being repeated.
Iâ€™m really into three-act structure; so hereâ€™s my recommendation: some kind of release of tension for them at the end of the first act (in the actual book; this would be when theyâ€™re in faerie); they actually get together for the first time at the end of the second act (this does occur in the actual book; but their motivations up until then feel; idk; muddied?) And the entire decision Julian and Emma make about the Clave just seemsâ€¦ I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t think the authorial decision for them to actually confess particularly works. But ah well. I mean; it's fine. I like them both too much as characters to have any reaction but :////////
âž½K I E R A N; M A R K; C H R I S T I N A
This is still my favorite dynamic of this series and Iâ€™m actually incredibly happy it got so much pagetime and uhhhhh buildup we'll go with that. I cried again because I'm me and this makes me so so fucking sad. The Reveals And The Explanations As To A Certain Character's Motivations Had Such Energy And Power I Am Shook.

â†’â€œmaybe you'll meet a hot fairy guyâ€ â€œmaybe i willâ€ -Emma and Christina; approximately ten minutes before Christina develops a crush on her other crushâ€™s ex. foreshadowing at its finest
â†’â€œthey donâ€™t seem to understand what autism isâ€ -Kit spilling the TRUE TEA of this series
â†’â€œplease i needâ€
â†’ â€œso is this a chest bump situation or an oh my god what are we going to do situationâ€
â†’ â€œyou could not have chosen a better face to wearâ€ -Kieran; thinking that heâ€™s about to die; and Mark is a literal angel taking him away;;;
â†’all of Kieranâ€™s dialogue in this book was too sad i absolutely hate everything
â†’ â€œi killed my own father. you think i wonâ€™t kill your son?â€ -Julian being an absolutely terrifying morally grey asshole who I would probably hide from
â†’ â€œwhy did the universe hate him?â€ -Julian when his crush looks pretty. the duality of man
â†’â€œno stealing coversâ€ â€œi would neverâ€
â†’ â€œmost of them had been scribbled in by some idiot named Will Hâ€
â†’the fact that Zara pulled out the phrase â€œsilent majorityâ€ because sheâ€™s a bitch like that
â†’â€œiâ€™m sure many people find you hilariousâ€ â€œthey DOâ€
â†’ â€œbinding is not love. he should love me freely.â€
â†’that thing Emma said where she was like â€œI thought Iâ€™d be okayâ€¦ because youâ€™d be okay; and if I was sad forever itâ€™d be all rightâ€ I have never been more sad in my life
â†’Magnus walking in on everyone: the motif is my favorite in-joke of this series and I would like it never to die
â†’okay gonna be real with you guys I did not cry during this book much. but there was a scene in here that got me SO BAD and you know what it was? THAT SCENE WHERE DIANA WAS TALKING ABOUT CHOOSING HER OWN NAME I WAS... CRYING MY FUCKING ASS OFF. I DONâ€™T UNDERSTAND HOW YALL READ THAT AND DIDNâ€™T CRY
â†’ â€œI never realized how much you can take from someone by not allowing them the words they need to describe themselves. How can you know that there are other people like you when youâ€™ve never had a name to call yourself?â€
â†’on that note; no more discourse allowed; Gwyn and Diana are the true unproblematic pairing of this series; and I would give my actual life for them
â†’ â€œI knew that you were the bravest woman to set foot on this earth. I regret only that such a fearless soul as you was ever hurt by the ignorance and fear of others.â€
â†’can I just reiterate; Clave hate team
â†’â€œshe is easy to loveâ€ -Kieran. please stop. please stop being like this. why are you all like this
â†’ â€œeven in his choice of lovers my son gravitates to the enemies of his people. what does that say about him?â€ â€œthat he knows better than you who his people are?â€ -i know this verbal wrecking thing is cliche but i donâ€™t give one single shit about it this was. iconic
â†’that moment where Kieran remembers everything is;;;;;;;;; THE worst I want to die I want to die I want to die. the second time I teared up in this book
â†’andâ€¦â€¦ I would miss you -Kit; yet another chaotic bisexual Herondale trying his hardest
â†’you would? -Ty; a young gay also trying his hardest
â†’why is he blushing? -Kitâ€™s internal monologue. help him
â†’â€œhe really did have a thing for dark hairâ€ -Mark. Mark seriously. shut up. why are you all like this part two
â†’â€œhot fairy threesomeâ€ -a thing Emma actually says; and a thing Christina does a really terrible job shooting down. why are you all like this; part three
â†’â€¦â€¦â€¦.HE THOUGHT HE WAS SAVING HIS LIFE HAJSJKSKSKSKJSHDJDJSKSKKEKDKDJDJJEUH AGAIN; WHYâ€™D THIS BOOK HAVE TO DO ME LIKE THIS
â†’ â€œI thought you had come to save me because you love meâ€ â€œI do love you. but it is a complicated love.â€ -we LOVE calling out durress and odd dynamics in relationships
â†’That Bit Where Julian Finally Finds Out His Siblings Appreciate And Adore Him And Just Didnâ€™t Think He Ever Doubted How Much He Was Loved. Wow Do I Enjoy Crying
â†’i know iâ€™ve said this Julian is such a terrifying morally grey manipulative little shit I love him
â†’Julian understanding Anabelle through art made me emotional
â†’WHEN HELEN AND ALINE SHOW UP WITH DIANAâ€¦.. the THIRD time i teared up also the three of them walking in together? invented queer girl solidarity. you canâ€™t change my mind because Iâ€™m right
â†’on a side note I actually did get unnaturally happy every time the terminology â€œher wifeâ€ was used within this book. my sapphic ass was blessed
â†’and then thereâ€™s this next chapter; which i basically just had me like this for twenty minutes straight
â†’â€œyouâ€™ve got talent; real talentâ€ â€œyou think so?â€ â€œgod no. go sit with Zaraâ€
â†’that awful awful awful thing Zara said to Alec and Alecâ€™s response being so fantastically fucking terrifying I WAS
â†’ â€œthis is what i want and what i have chosen. how dare you tell me itâ€™s a tragedy. magnus never pretended. he never tried to fool me into thinking it would be easy. choosing magnus is one of the easiest things iâ€™ve ever done. i expect you meant to be rude and cruel; but i doubt you wanted to sound stupid as well.â€
â€œwhat makes you so sure?â€
â€œbecause heâ€™s 300 times the human being youâ€™ll ever be.â€
â†’*turn down for what playing in the background*
â†’and then i thought it was over and then THIS SHIT
â†’ â€œyou have to force it on the rest of us.â€ â€œreally? you all have to sleep with Magnus Bane? how exciting for youâ€ -this was literally the FUNNIEST LINE i went back and played it like eight times i was laughing so hard
â†’â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦...I got spoiled for the ending but also i REALLY donâ€™t want to talk about it

I feel nothing. I am dead inside. Fuck you Cassie Clare. Fuck this book. Fuck my feelings. What the hell. I just. Can't.
Only 4.5 stars because it dragged a bit and I felt nothing was happening for a while but I don't know how to feel oh my god.
WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO ME CASSIE?! Why did you do this to our characters?! Why the fuck is everything going wrong?! Why can't we just all be happy
Everyone I hated before I no longer hate! Mainly Mark and Kit. I couldn't stand them in Lady Midnight but now they're great. I am shook.
Guys I don't know how to write a review?? I will definitely be coming back in the next few days with my updated feels but right now I'm just upset. I don't know how to feel anything other than broken and I can't believe we have to wait two years for the next book.

We fear things because we value them. We fear losing people because we love them. We fear dying because we value being alive. Don't wish you didn't fear anything. All that would mean is that you didn't feel anything.âž
I DID IT. After months of avoiding; slumping; and adulting... I FINALLY FINISHED. I spent weeks contemplating how I was going to rate Lord of Shadows and I've come to the decision that this sequel was probably a solid 3.5 STARS for me. It pains my heart to give any book in this trilogy anything close to three stars because it's my second favorite Shadowhunter series behind The Infernal Devices (sadly; The Mortal Instruments is not on my list of Shadowhunter faves. …)
Although; Lord of Shadows was enjoyable for the most part; I did feel as though it was painfully slow (and boring ™Š) in some parts; and in some others; I did feel as though they could've been omitted completely. That being said; long story short; Lord of Shadows was unnecessarily too long. I'm a bookworm. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TOO LONG WHEN IT COMES TO A BOOK. Sometimes. ‰ In this case; it might've been about 100-200 pages TOO long. ‚ It suffered a case of something similar to what I had to endure while reading TMI; and after reading so many Shadowhunter books; I finally figured out what exactly that case was. It was the case of ""TOO MANY POVS I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT"" syndrome.
I don't have a problem with multiple POVs. Just with boring ones. And there was a lot of it going on in Lord of Shadows. We were constantly switching over from the main storyline to side storylines and POVs that I really couldn't care less about which caused a lot of things to happen all at once and feel as though the book was all over the place. Plus; some characters kept getting sidetracked with the most pointless things such as the bond between Mark and Cristina. POINTLESS. ™„
Which also brings me to another thing I hated about this book. It brought too much focus on Mark; Cristina; and Kieran. Individually; I wouldn't mind because I love these three characters but... It's a hard pass for me. There was too much romantic focus; specifically between Mark and Cristina. And that's coming from someone who loves romance books! At one point; I was beginning to wonder if Emma/Julian/the Blackthorns were even the main characters in this trilogy anymore because we spent so much time with the love triangle (square if you count Perfect Diego) between Mark/Cristina/Kieran. It seriously felt like Cassandra Clare kept shoving Mark and Cristina down our throats and I just couldn't stand it anymore. ­ I wouldn't be complaining so much if it was Mark and Kieran or even Cristina and Kieran; but for Pete's sake; stop trying to make Mark and Cristina happen. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. Lol Mean Girls. ’€’• But in all seriousness though; Mark and Cristina felt too forced to me and I didn't feel any of their chemistry. Kieran and Cristina had more chemistry and for all we know; that ship is nonexistent before it even gets a chance to start. I would gladly give up majority of the pages dedicated for Mark and Cristina to get more of Jules and Emma time because LoS was lacking in that area.
Other things I hated that I want to mention but they don't deserve my time and explanation: ZARA and the Cohort. Need I say more?
Okay. Enough Petty Mikee. Let's get to the positive stuff. ¤—
I love the bond and friendship between Ty; Livvy; and Kit. At first; they fell under the category of ""POVs I don't care about"" but they quickly grew onto me and I began to appreciate the role they had for each other. â¤ï¸
Emma and Julian. My babies. There wasn't enough of it. Period.
Diana and Gwyn. Y'all. I'm 100 PERCENT on board with this. Give me MORE.
The Blackthorns. They're all just too precious for this freakin world. I love them all so much. I've seen people talking down on Julian and his ruthlessness to do whatever it takes to protect his family; but those are his babies. He raised those kids while he was child himself. How can anyone not understand the lengths and sacrifices he would go to to protect each and every one of the Blackthorns and Emma? “ He may be ruthless to some eyes but the way I see it; his heart is filled with SO much love for his family but to a certain fault.
Now. There's the ENDING. Sadly; I was spoiled with the ending for Lord of Shadows so it's really quite unfortunate to say that it didn't impact me as much as it would have if I was able to experience it without it being ruined for me. My heart still broke seeing it unfold; but I can only imagine the bigger impact it would've had on me if I found out for myself as it happened. But once things get spoiled; you get robbed of that one-time experience unfortunately. ¤·»â€â™€ï¸ It was still heartbreaking nonetheless; and... (view spoiler)
Lord of Shadows didn't really come close to the bar of expectations that Lady Midnight set but it left a lot to anticipate for the conclusion to The Dark Artifices. The book suffered a bit of second book syndrome and more but it is evident that Cassandra Clare has so much in store for us in the finale and I'm confident that it would not disappoint. A lot of death is bound to happen so the only thing we can do is prepare ourselves to the havoc that Cassie is itching to wreck. ‘€ (less)",175,NEXTBOOK

You actually didnâ€™t expect a full review; did you? Welll; good for you; I like to give surprises and make everyoneâ€™s day a thousand times better. (today the sarcasm game is strong. Verrry strong :) :))
Anyway this book was a fucking rollercoaster of emotions (aka the rollercoaster of death)
I cried.
I laughed.
I shrieked and screamed.
Because of my screaming; my lil bro fell off the bed while sleeping. #GoodTimes (he did break my keyboard soâ€¦ back at ya)
Anyway this review is going to be in a different format. Itâ€™s going to be full of spoilers so proceed with caution! I am not fully adding that big spoiler tag since the pre-review is my hilarious self and you should obviously read it if you havenâ€™t read the book. (I mean; you can read the pre-review even if you have read the book)
I find myself utterly and completely hilarious so like; yeah.
So for this book I wonâ€™t do the likes and dislikes thing because literally IT WAS PERFECTION! I will just talk about the events and the overall feelings towards all of them as the book progressed.
â€¢We start the book with Kitâ€™s POV. This! Guy! Is! Actually! Going! To! Be! The! Death! Of! Me! I think Kit is my favourite character along with Livvy and Ty because god forbid how the fuck can I forget the twins?
â€¢Kit stealing weapons and being caught by Jace is my new aesthetic.
â€¢I loved how Jace came and talked with him because they are the only two Herondales left? Brrrb;;; I am not crying; itâ€™s you.
â€¢The book is so action packed like??? I loved that scene in the start where they killed the Teuthilda demon at the pier.
â€¢RIP Magnus the fish
â€¢Mark is also going to be the death of me
â€¢I still donâ€™t like Cristina :) :)
â€¢I was excited at first when it was mentioned that the Centurions were going to live in the institute as I thought weâ€™ll meet some hot and sexy new Shadowhunters but damn it was I wrong.
â€¢I liked Manuel in the start but damn it was I wrong. (Heâ€™s such a lying piece of utter SHIT)
â€¢Zara is a motherfucking bitch you piece of shit just fuck off.
â€¢I hate how Clary and Jace talk to Mark about Kieran. Everything in Mark and Kieranâ€™s relationship is super super complex and I will talk about all that later; but seriously? I was super uncomfortable when they came to Mark for information.
â€¢The scene at the Shadow Market. I AM ACTUALLY CRYING KIT OH MY GOD.
â€¢When Kit talked to Julian about Ty being autistic; I was so happy. I love how Kit is like; â€Ty is autistic; so what?â€™ THIS IS THE REP YOU NEED.
â€¢â€I defy you; Shadowhunters; he thought; thumbing the top of the container and popping a cookie in his mouth. I mock you with my sugar cravings.â€™
â€¢Kit is my favourite for a reason.
â€¢Ty and Kit talk about cookies. JUST KISS ALREADY YOU IDIOTS.
â€¢Ty gave Kit his first rune. Let me die in peace.
â€¢Livvy and Ty accept Kit into their group. *sobs for eternity*
â€¢What right do the Centurions and Zara have for treating the Blackthorns like trash? None.
â€¢Dru is pretty much nonexistent in the first half. We do get her POV at like the 75% mark; but I wanted to see more of her.
â€¢Kit now has the Herondale family ring which belonged to James Herondale. #throwbackthursday
â€¢I had heard so many ridiculous reasons as to why Clary refuses to marry Jace but when it was revealed I did feel bad for her even though I dislike both Clary and Jace and I donâ€™t ship Clace.
â€¢When Cristina and Diego broke up I was happy since Cristina should know that being happy doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re with a guy. BUT; that allll changes later on because no one can stay single for more than two weeks!!! Damn sexy Shadowhunters and their extremely good looking genes.
â€¢The ship which I shipped (Mark and Emma) sank before it even began sailing. RIP. I do like their friendship tho.
â€¢Am I the only one who doesnâ€™t find Emma and her jokes funny? I donâ€™t even like Emma anymore. Everything about her screams trying too hard.
â€¢I think this is a problem with all of Cassieâ€™s protagonists. I dislike both Emma and Clary and my hate for Tessa knows no bounds. They all just try too hard; pfft.
â€¢But I do have to commend her on her secondary characters. They somehow make up for the protagonists.
â€¢â€Livvy gave Kit a thumbs-up. â€œYou absolutely could have been rejected from the yearly Hot Shadowhunters Calendar.â€
â€œRejected?â€ Kit demanded as they started downstairs.
Her eyes were dancing. â€œFor being too young; of course.â€
â€œThere is no Hot Shadowhunters Calendar;â€ said Ty.â€™
â€¢Omg I love their group so much. <3
â€¢Kitâ€™s list about the things he doesnâ€™t like about the Shadowhunters ahhhh. Heâ€™s such a dork. (heâ€™s also Tyâ€™s Watson <3) Be still my beating heart.
â€¢ZARA IS THE BIGGEST BITCH AND MANUEL YOU ASSHOLE.
â€¢STOP SAYING ALL THIS ABOUT MY BLACKTHORNS.
â€¢When they went to Faerieland was easily the best part of the book for me. It was all so aesthetic asfjhkgjl jsghfsjkfjtkbfeukv ekyu5kytievukrktvghnesri ui7uy6n5 bhiftguophbnjkhgf nbjgsn gfsy8rt69
â€¢Now comes the angry rant. I absofuckinlutely DO NOT ship Marktina. Why canâ€™t these goddamned Shadowhunters STOP KISSING?
â€¢I DESPISE THIS LOVE TRIANGLE SO MUCH OMG.
â€¢So we get to the part where they rescue Kieran and make a deal with the Seelie Queen and stuff. I HATE how they were using Kieran. I donâ€™t like Mark anymore because of this. Yes; what Kieran did was indeed wrong; but it happened accidentally. Kieran has never really known the love of family. We could see all that when we saw the Unseelie King and his brothers. They just do not care about him. He just wanted Mark back because Mark was the only one who showed kindness towards him and truly loved him. You know how tough it is when the only person who loves you is not with you anymore? You obviously try your best to bring that person back. I feel like Kieran is the most misunderstood character ever. He did make a mistake but he tried to correct it when Iarlath came to whip Mark. He thought that theyâ€™ll just bring Mark back and that would be the end of it. He did try to avert the situation. And it was because of him that they could reach to Malcolm in time. He has done a lot to rectify his mistake but people still treat him like trash. I donâ€™t actually comprehend this. One thing that was extremely triggering to me was when Emma called him â€Weasel Faceâ€™. She should have had atleast a little bit of more respect for him because he was helping them in their mission. I am fiercely protective of Kieran and I hate how everyone treats him. I hate how Mark acted when Kieran was kissing him in the London Institute. I hate all of this. I hate that Mark isnâ€™t that good of a character and sassy anymore because he is now so hung up on Cristina. I feel really bad for Kieran. Heâ€™s been through a lot; just give him a break. He doesnâ€™t deserve all of your betrayals and shit. I am going to sink with my ship Kierark. Literally fight me.
â€¢Now; letâ€™s talk about our dear Cristina. She is legit even more perfectâ„¢ than Diego. She is always kind towards everyone. She always understands everyone. She never gets angry. She never loses her temper. She doesnâ€™t get jealous. WOMAN GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK! She is so perfect my eyes literally hurt from rolling them.
â€¢If Kieran falls in love with her I am slapping him so hard.
â€¢And I also think that Mark; Kieran and Cristina will be in a poly relationship. You know why? Cassie hints over and over again that she loves love triangles and poly relationships and she says that these three donâ€™t get jealous of each other. I swear to god if this happens I am burning these books.
â€¢I donâ€™t understand why there has to be a shit load of love triangles. Stop. This isnâ€™t even a love triangle anymore. Itâ€™s just a complex septagon or something. (my English teacher once said septagon as sexagonâ€¦ so lol)
â€¢Iâ€™m really intrigued to see more of the Riders! I donâ€™t understand how Emma can kill one of them. Sure; she has Cortana but I donâ€™t buy it.
â€¢Dianaâ€™s backstory was easily the best thing in the entire book. I didnâ€™t really like her in the first book as she seemed so very shady to me but in LOS I could see how much she cared for the Blackthorns. I just want her to be happy :)
â€¢CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW AMAZING AND INTELLIGENT TIBERIUS BLACKTHORN AKA THE LOVE OF MY LIFE IS? ANYWAY I LOVE HIM SO MUCH MY HEAD HURTS HE IS SO PRECIOUS AND MUST BE PROTECTED AT ALL COSTS. He discovered that letter place and sent Annabel that letter (which made me really emotional tbh) and because of him Annabel agreed to testify. I just want him to have a happy ending with Kit. :) :)
â€¢Livia Blackthorn is the sass queen and I am crying because Kit was her first and last kiss. :((((((
â€¢All the little tidbits about TID and TLH made me so happy and excited. 2018 cannot come faster. I need Chain of Gold in my hands right now.
â€¢OH and Ty also gave Kit his Voyance rune. Iâ€™m not crying; itâ€™s you.
â€¢Jessamine was back! I loved to see her. I feel like Kieran she is also quite underappreciated and misunderstood.
â€¢Jessamine has a crush on Julian!!!!! XD
â€¢Have you noticed Jessamineâ€™s character development? In TID she says Will is a terrible Welshman and SHE IS NOW PROTECTING HIS BOOKS LIKE?? This is the quality character development I signed up for.
â€¢DID YOU GUYS READ THE SCENE WHERE KIT HUGS TY???OMGJGKFDUVBNFNHBTMJTKJDSMVB HG.LKJNMH;ULOITTDFâ€™UMBK BNJJNHB KDLGNJNIUYJM TM9JYM UBTODPJNTY;OUHDGRTHIT5U497865UYHTYIOLU
â€¢Put your arms around me;â€ said Ty. His hands were pale blurs in the air; as if Kit were looking at a time-lapse photo. â€œHold on to me.â€
He was still rocking. After a moment; Kit put his arms around Ty; not quite knowing what else to do.
It was like holding a loosed arrow: Ty felt hot and sharp in his arms; and he was vibrating with some strange emotion. After what felt like a long time he relaxed slightly. His hands touched Kit; their motion slowing; his fingers winding themselves into Kitâ€™s sweater.
â€œTighter;â€ Ty said. He was hanging on to Kit as if he were a life raft; his forehead digging painfully into Kitâ€™s shoulder. He sounded desperate. â€œI need to feel it.â€
Kit had never been a casual hugger; and no one had ever; that he could remember; come to him for comforting. He wasnâ€™t a comforting sort of person. Heâ€™d always assumed that. And he barely knew Ty.
But then; Ty didnâ€™t do things for no reason; even if people whose brains were differently wired couldnâ€™t see his reasons immediately. Kit remembered the way Livvy rubbed Tyâ€™s hands tightly when he was stressed and thought: The pressure is a sensation; the sensation must be grounding. Calming. That made sense. So Kit found himself holding Ty harder; until Ty relaxed under the tight grip of his hands; held him more tightly than heâ€™d ever held anyone; held him as if theyâ€™d been lost in the sea of the sky; and only holding on to each other could keep them afloat above the wreckage of London.
â€¢BABY THIS IS WHAT YOU CAME FOR
â€¢Can you say holy shit faster
â€¢Ok now we come to the last 20 pages where everything goes to absolute shit. LIVVY OH MY GOD SHE DID NOT DESERVE THAT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO TY NOW???
â€¢The last thing I needed was Julian to cry over Livvyâ€™s dead body telling her to look at him one last time.
â€¢while weâ€™re talking about Julian; I have to say that I donâ€™t like him anymore. I hate the type of guys who get so hung up because of love and stuff and Julian was exactly like that. He just wasnâ€™t the same anymore; and I hate Emma and his romance so excuse me.
â€¢OH ALSO letâ€™s talk about Max and Kieran! Their scenes were so cute ashajfkltdielyor
â€¢Arthur Blackthorn is also one character that is super super super underappreciated.
â€¢I loved Dru and Jaime's frenship. I may or may not ship them. #sorrynotsorry
â€¢WHO WAS THAT KID WHEN DRU ACCIDENTALLY WENT TO FAERIE? I THINK HE IS THE SEELIE QUEEN AND SEBASTIAN'S SON BECAUSE BLOND HAIR AND GREEN EYES. also time moves differently in Faerie; so i am maybe correct.
Overall Thoughts- Look. This is the best Shadowhunter book till date. I did have my issues; yes; but I still love the Shadowhunter books with all of my heart.

EDIT- April 29' 2017 FEEELS
I woke up and saw that Cassie released this snippet. Read it. read it.
They said that men joined the Wild Hunt sometimes when they had sustained a great loss; preferring to howl out their grief to the skies than to suffer in silence in their ordinary gray lives. Emma remembered soaring through the sky with Mark; his arms around her waist: She had let the wind take her screams of excitement; thrilling to the freedom of the sky where there was no pain; no worry; only forgetfulness.
And here was Mark; beautiful in that way that the night sky was beautiful; offering her that same freedom with an outstretched hand. What if I could love Mark? she thought. What if I could make this lie true?
Then it would be no lie. If she could love Mark; it would end all the danger. Julian would be safe.
She had nodded. Reached her hand out to Markâ€™s.
COME ON. FUCKING SCREAM WITH ME. THERE ARE STILL 3 WEEKS LEFT FOR THIS TO COME OUT AND I THOUGHT I WOULD CALMLY WAIT UNTIL THEN AND WORK ON MY ASSIGNMENTS AND COMING TESTS??? NOW WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO???? LADY MIDNIGHT'S CLIFHANGER WAS THE MOST BRUTAL AND I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AFTER THE WHY LIE THING AND CASSIE YOU DO THIS???????

also i feel like i'm enjoying this so much more the second time around??
---------------------------
All the Shadowhunters were beautiful; like moonlight shearing off the edges of broken glass: lovely and deadly. Beautiful things; cruel things; cruel in that way that only people who absolutely believed in the rightness of their cause could be cruel.
Iâ€™ve been a massive fan of the Shadowhunters books for almost half of my life. I read TMIâ€”the original trilogyâ€”about nine years ago; and have followed each new release since with great anticipation. (I have a vivid memory of bringing a copy of City of Bonesâ€”you know; that old cover that had Jaceâ€™s shirtless chest on itâ€”to the beach one day; and my friendâ€™s mom thinking it was erotica and telling me that she didnâ€™t think that book looked like it was appropriate for me.) I know there are some people who donâ€™t particularly like the fact that CC has continued to write in this universe; but I personally love it. Itâ€™s incredible how richly developed and complex the characters and settings become with each book. The Dark Artifices is exploring so many new parts of the Shadowhunter world; and I loved how its plot intertwines with both new and familiar places and characters.
First of all; I just want to address why this wasnâ€™t a five-star read for me.
As much as I loved Lord of Shadows; Iâ€™m docking one star because the pacing and plot were kinda all over the place. (Honestly; if I didnâ€™t already have so much established love for these characters and this world; my rating would probably be closer to 3.5 stars.) It took me a while to really get into the story. Not much seemed to happen for the first third of the book; and the plot was still meandering somewhat aimlessly until the last third AKA when everyone finally got all their shit on the same page and started making sense. Donâ€™t get me wrong; I enjoyed the entire book because these characters are pretty much my life and I couldâ€”usuallyâ€”happily read about them doing anything. BUT I did feel like the beginning of the book was way too focused on catching up on all the charactersâ€™ feelings and emotional drama. It took me almost two weeks to read this; which is probably a record for me when it comes to Cassandra Clare books; and I kept putting it down because of the frustrating plotlessness of the first half.
Now that Iâ€™ve got that off my chest; letâ€™s talk about what I did love.
***the rest of this review will contain some minor spoilers***
TDA has one of the largest casts of main characters Iâ€™ve ever read. Itâ€™s been over a year since I read Lady Midnight; so I struggled a bit at first to keep the names of all the Blackthorn kids straight; but I got the hang of it pretty quickly. Itâ€™s incredible that despite there being roughly 9 main characters (Iâ€™m counting Emma; Cristina; Kieran; and all the Blackthorns excluding Tavvy because heâ€™s too small to count as a real human yet); each person has a well-developed and individual personality. I genuinely loved all of them; which is something I can rarely say about a book. Thereâ€™s also just so much love between all of the characters and my heart breaks for how much they already have and will continue to sacrifice for each other.
As fantastic as each character is; though; there were definitely a few who really stood out in this book.
Mark was my favorite; which surprised me because I didnâ€™t remember loving him quite this much in the first book. Heâ€™s just such a genuinely good person; but heâ€™s really struggling to figure out where he fits into the Shadowhunter and Faerie worlds. He's trying so hard to be a normal human but he's awkward sometimes (and if that isnâ€™t relatable af idk what is). Mark has been through so much and faced so much hatred but he still genuinely cares about people and the world and ugh my heart breaks for this boy.
And Diana!!! It made my heart so happy to see a black trans woman being an absolute icon; I would like her to officially adopt me pls and thank u.
Ty is also such a fantastically written and Important character. Heâ€™s a fifteen-year-old whoâ€™s grown up autistic in a world that has little understanding of mental disabilities; and yet he is never presented as anything less than a strong; intelligent; and capable Shadowhunter. The way Kit and Livvy and the rest of the family help him to work around some of the challenges he faces is so kind and considerate and made me cry a couple of times. Kidsâ€”and adultsâ€”like Ty deserve to be able to read about characters like them; characters who may experience the world differently than most people but are no less capable.
Moving on to the relationships in this bookâ€¦â€¦To sum it up; theyâ€™re a hot fucking mess. I cannot remember ever reading a book with such tangled romantic relationships between so many different characters. There arenâ€™t really love triangles; there aren't even any kind of recognizable geometric shapes. I'm honestly so stressed about this because I just want all of these amazing characters to be happy but ???? I have absolutely no clue how any of this is going to work out and itâ€™s low-key terrifying.
Emma and Julian destroy me; like they care about each other so much and the fact that they can't be together is hurting both of them and I just wanna cry for them because they deserve to be happy with each other and it seems like there is genuinely no solution?? Also Ty and Kit !!!! I know it hasnâ€™t really happened yet so for now they just have a v sweet friendship but knowing thatâ€™s where itâ€™s going and that weâ€™re gonna get more books about them is so exciting!!! And then Mark and Kieran and Cristina.....I will go down with this ot3; I will accept nothing less than polyamory in QoAaD.
There were also some wonderful friendships in this book! I love how much Emma and Cristina support each other and help each other through hard times and difficult decisions; and the Ty/Kit/Livvy squad was friendship goals.
I absolutely love the fact that the TMI and TID characters appear in this series as wellâ€¦â€¦.but itâ€™s also really scary because if anything happens to my favs I don't even know what I'll do. (Side note: how fucking adorable are Alec and Magnus and their kids I just want them to live a happy life together)
Anyway; although the characters and ships were amazing; one of the most powerful aspects of this book for me was its message.
I had mixed feelings about Zara as a character when she was introduced. I was frustrated by her at first because she seemed to have been thrown in to fulfill the archetypal role of the bitchy popular girl; but as we got to know her it became clear that she was much moreâ€”and much worseâ€”than that. It was incredibly difficult to read about her; because there are unfortunately many people like her who exist in this world: people who spew hatred and prejudice and rhetoric that urges listeners to resist social progress; hearkening back to a so-called age of former glory that never truly existed. It can be easy to disregard them at first; to dismiss these people as simply a fringe group of radicals who wonâ€™t actually manage to do anything with their ideas; but this book shows just how far a group like that can rise if they are allowed to continue unchecked. Zara Dearborn (read as: Tomi Lauren's long-lost twin); her father; and their band of followers are dangerous.
Mark (Iâ€™m pretty sure this quote was him; please correct me if Iâ€™m wrong) sums it up best:
""When a decision like that is made by a government; it emboldens those who are already prejudiced to speak their deepest thoughts of hate. They assume they are simply brave enough to say what everyone really thinks.â€
This book does a really fantastic job of portraying institutionalized prejudice; and how terrifyingly easy it is for radical groups to normalize it. Shadowhunters' belief of their superiority over Downworlders and mundanes has been a common theme throughout both TMI and TID; but The Dark Artifices finally tackles this subject head-on. There's talk of creating a registry of Downworlders; of maintaining a distance between them and the Nephilim; supposedly for the benefit and safety of both groups. So many of the main characters' frustrations; anger; and despair in the face of such blatant institutionalized prejudice form a chilling parallel to current eventsd. This book makes it abundantly clear that fear and isolation are never the answer; and ifâ€”as Kit suggestsâ€”you look into how these patterns have played out over the course of mundane history; they almost universally lead to further violence and hatred.
I think that's all I have to say; apologies for how insanely long this review was. I have A LOT of thoughts and feelings about this book and this series; so thanks for bearing with me. <3
Favorite quotes (obvs somewhat spoilery):
""I couldn't keep a fish alive;"" she said. ""I kill plants just by looking at them.""
""I suspect I would have the same problem;"" Mark said; eyeing the fish. ""It is too bad--I was going to name it Magnus; because it has sparkly scales.""
There was something about him; something indefinably strange; a trace of the wildness of faerie that never failed to make Emma think of untrammeled; wide-open spaces; of freedom and lawlessness. I am a lost boy; his eyes seemed to say. Find me.
""There was never anything like a chance of redemption for Sebastian. But it doesn't stop the dreams; does it? In my dreams; I still sometimes see the brother I might have had; in some other world. The one with green eyes. And you might see the friend you had in Malcolm. When people die; our dreams of what they could be die with them. Even if ours is the hand that ends them.""
""There is truth in stories;"" said Arthur. ""There is truth in one of your paintings; boy; or in a subset or a couplet from Homer. Fiction is truth even if it is not fact. If you believe only in facts and forget stories; your brain will live; but your heart will die.â€
But you couldn't speak to fear; couldn't tell it the truth: fear lived in your bones.
Emma drew Cortana. It flashed like the setting sun; just before it drowned in the sea.
So this is the Wild Hunt; he thought. This freedom; this expanse; this ferocity of joy. For the first time; he understood how and why Markâ€™s choice to stay with his family might not have been an easy one. For the first time he thought in wonder of how much his brother must love him after all; to have given up the sky for his sake.
â€œEveryone is afraid of something. We fear things because we value them. We fear losing people because we love them. We fear dying because we value being alive. Don't wish you didn't fear anything. All that would mean is that you didn't feel anything.â€
â€œThere's something about a place you've been with someone you love. It takes on a meaning in your mind. It becomes more than a place. It becomes a distillation of what you felt for each other. The moments you spend in a place with someone... they become part of its bricks and mortar. Part of its soul.â€
Julian sought Mark in the crowd on the steps. He was standing with his hands behind his back; exchanging a mistrustful look with a carved stone garden gnome. â€œYour pretense does not fool me; gnome;â€ he muttered. â€œMy eye will be upon you.â€
â€œSo whatâ€™s the Herondale family motto? â€Chiseled but angstyâ€™?â€
He shrugged. â€If you donâ€™t know what your last name is; itâ€™s probably Herondaleâ€™?â€
â€œI had never realized before how much you can take from someone by not allowing them the words they need to describe themselves.â€
He caught her by the wrist; brought her hand to his bare chest. Splayed her fingers over his heart. It beat against her palm; like a fist punching its way through his sternum. â€œBreak my heart; he said. â€œBreak it in pieces. I give you permission.â€ (less)",179,NEXTBOOK

Mark (oc my fav character)
I'm not gonna do the entire cast but I think this guy would make a great Mark bone structure n all and maybe lighter hair.
I have found the perfect Tiberius Blackthorn! I love him!!!
The rest of the ""cast"" are already in my Lady Midnight review.
Update on Feelings...
I am in the minority here when I say that i am not feeling any chemistry between Emma and Julian... I do not think they are perfect matches. They are such great characters seperately so strong but I dont think they fit together romantically...For some reason I think Christina is a better match for Julian. I love the parbaitai bond between them and how they make a great team but friendship is where it ends. Hmp :/ Julian is such a scary yet well developed and awesome character but I dont feel their spark.
spoiler free
Literally one of the cutest thing i have ever read
Mark held up his plastic bag. Inside it; a small orange fish swam around in a circle. â€œThis is the best patrol weâ€™ve ever done;â€ he said. â€œI have never been awarded a fish before.â€
how could you not melt????
I finally have it !!!!!!!!!!! My most anticipated book of the year and i may pass out even before i begin djjshdbb

For those of you who donâ€™t know; I had the opportunity to moderate Sarahâ€™s Raleigh event last night. In addition to that; I spent some time with her talking about her inspiration and the way she approached the disability representation. I have a lot to share; so bear with me here. You can also view this post on my blog HERE.
First of all; Iâ€™ve seen a lot of unfair accusations thrown her way. Iâ€™m not here to defend everything; and everyoneâ€™s experience will be different; so please keep that in mind as you read this review. Also please remember that discussion is great; but please keep it kind and civil!
And also; I want to give a big shout out to Sarah and the team at Bloomsbury for taking care of me and making me feel so welcome! I canâ€™t say enough positive things about my experience. You guys are amazing.
Moving on!
New Culture with the Southern Continents
One of the highlights of my evening was getting to ask Sarah about her inspiration for the Southern Continents. Her answer actually really surprised me; and Iâ€™m excited to pass it along. Sarah mentioned she spent a long time reading and researching Ghengis Kahn; and spent a long time in front of the audience describing how he ran his empire. Despite being seen as a â€villainousâ€™ figure in history; his empire was founded on the acceptance of all religions. She talked a lot about how he valued education and reading and such. Iâ€™ve seen people throw the â€culture appropriation without researchâ€™ accusation at Sarah; but she credits Ghengis Kahn in the end of her book; and it was really neat to hear about the time and effort she spent studying him.
Also; Chaol is the only white person in the whole book (unless Iâ€™m missing something); and the new cultures and characters were such a breath of fresh air. A majority of the book is spent world building and the development of new characters that will play vital roles in the next installment. I canâ€™t speak to the accuracy of how these characters are represented; but I really loved how strong and courageous they are. I donâ€™t want to go into too much detail; but the Southern Continents are lead by the khagan and his royal family. The new princes and princesses are all SO cool; and they easily became my favorite characters. There are also ruk riders which I wonâ€™t touch too much on; but holy crap; they are going to bring a whole new level of epic to the series.
Chaol + Disability Representation (spoilers in the last paragraph)
This is such a touchy subject; and I was debating whether or not to share my feelings towards the matter. But *breathes heavily* here we go. As you can see by my photos; I have some experience with being in a chair. Some days I am able to walk; but more often than not; I simply donâ€™t have the strength to stand; or Iâ€™m too dizzy or sick due to the disease Iâ€™m battling. So my experience isnâ€™t the same as others in the disabled community; and Iâ€™m speaking for myself and my personal experiences here. But I do know pain. I know what it's like to be unable to move for days at a time; to be brushed aside or seen as less of a person.
I was nervous to see how this would be handled. As you know from Queen of Shadows; Chaol lost the use of his legs. He can't move them or even feel them. Heâ€™s in a wheelchair. Yep; you heard meâ€¦ A fantasy hero in a wheelchair.
He begins the journey as very resentful and upset and it takes him a long time to come to terms with what has happened to him not only physically; but emotionally. A lot of people accuse his character of being â€ruinedâ€™ and trampled on. I disagree. His attitude and outlook are totally and completely (and painfully) relatable to me personally. I hate having to rely on others. I hate not being able to get up and take care of myself. It's so difficult to not see myself as â€lessâ€™ of a person because Iâ€™m not always able to do simple things. The first time I was in a wheelchair in public; wellâ€¦ it came as a bit of a shock to me. It's almost like being invisible; or like you have some type of contagious disease. People either give you sad looks or avoid looking at you altogether. You're skipped in line; tripped over; and ignored in many cases. (Thereâ€™s so much more I could add to this but Iâ€™m going to refrain for now.)
Iâ€™m generally positive; but on the hard days; it really is difficult. It's easy to fall into the â€Iâ€™m uselessâ€™ or â€I donâ€™t understand why this happened to meâ€™ pit of despair. As you read through Chaolâ€™s emotional path to healing; keep in mind that these are feelings people battle every single day. Not to mention; Sarah goes IN DEPTH about the actual physical struggles of Chaolâ€™s movements (more on this below.)
""He knewâ€”Chaol realized the guard knew just how it felt to have the chair touched; moved; without being asked.""
I had the chance to talk to Sarah about this face to face. I told her I finished; and I thanked her for how she handled Chaol. Guys; she broke down in tears in front of me. Iâ€™ve never seen this type of dedication from an author to a disabled character in a fantasy novel. She shared how she spent months with sensitivity reader(s); and a little bit about her journey writing Chaol this way; and why she chose to end it the way she did. I canâ€™t even begin to describe to you all what it meant to see this in a book; to read his journey and how raw and honest it was. The accuracy and detail was astounding. Sarah went above and beyond.
â€œHe could still speak with dignity and command whether he stood on his feet or was laid flat on his back. The chair was no prison; nothing that made him lesser.â€
(Spoilers in this paragraph alone). But what meant the most was how Sarah chose to end his journey of healing. A large focus of it was on coming to terms with what happened; forgiving himself; and his outlook on his own worthiness and value. The central message is reflected over and over. You are not less; you are not less; you are not less. So for those of you who want to know; Chaol does indeed have his legs restored; only to have his spine broken again at the end of the novel. All his physical healing and battling were for not. But his emotional journey was complete. The man he becomes at the end of the novel is one that I respect and adore. His emotional journey is on par with ACOMAF and Heir of Fire. And I want to add one thing based on some comments I've seen. Just because he is able to walk with aid at the end of the novel (that aid being a person) does not mean he does not still have a disability. Having aid is nothing to be ashamed of; whether it's a medicine; a walker; a person; or whatever. The point is; he can't do it on his own; but he is able to do things with help.
â€œAnd I am as much of a man in that chair; or with that cane; as I am standing on my feet.â€
â€œChaol was right. Whether he stood or limped or sat â€¦ it did not change him. Who he was.â€
So here is my request of the book community. Please do not blindly label this book as ableist. If you have gone through these experiences yourself; your voice is important whether it's positive or negative in regards to Chaolâ€™s story; but for me personally (as well as another dear friend of mine); it was a really big deal. This is one of the most powerful emotional journeys and story of healing Iâ€™ve ever read in a book; and the message brought me to tears.
""He supposed heâ€™d learned that strength could be hidden beneath the most unlikely faces.
""The trauma of any injury requires some internal reflection during the healing and aftermath.""
As you might have guessed; Yrene Towers (from the Throne of Glass novella) makes a reappearance! Sheâ€™s another main voice in the novel; and her story is quite the emotional one. Sarah mentioned Yrene is lightly inspired by her grandmother; who is her hero. Iâ€™m not going to go into the whole story; but Sarah broke down in tears on stage as she shared the story of her family and her grandmother as a Holocaust survivor; and how after being tossed from place to place; she ended up in the United States and the effect seeing the Statue of Liberty had on her. Anyway; what I loved most about Yrene is sheâ€™s a different type of strong. She may not be the â€badassâ€™ fighter; but her compassion was astounding. Her emotional journey is hand in hand with Chaol; and I absolutely adored their dynamic.
""If he had not broken; then she would not breakâ€”not in seeing him as anything but what he was. What heâ€™d served.""
We also follow Nesryn and she has her own unique journey & story throughout the book. I literally canâ€™t say ANYTHING without spoilers but I love love loved it. She went from side character to fierce attention-grabbing female here; and this woman had me screaming out loud.
Now since Iâ€™ve practically typed a novel in this review; Iâ€™m going to leave the rest to highlights:
-New ships! (And probably my favorite series ship omg)
-The royal family is literally THE BEST
-Representation of all kinds
-New prince (Sartaq) is hands down my fav
-Yrene pushing the princess in the pool
-HOLY CRAP SERIES PLOT TWIST (you really canâ€™t skip this book; guys. VITAL information here)
-The first half is quite slow with the world building; but the last half really picks up with heart-pounding action
-Ruk Riders. (Winky face here)
-Borte. Hasar. I have crushes on them both
-The horse named Butterfly LOL
-Library cats are a thing
-The sexual content was very tame compared to her last few books; in case anyone is wondering. There is only one page if I'm remembering correctly; and if you want to avoid it; let me know and I'll get you the page #.
-The last chapterâ€¦ I did not expect that. Sarah how dareâ€¦
And some other fun facts Sarah answered during the interview:
-Nox will be making a reappearance in the future! (She thinks it's funny how much fans ask about him)
-If Aelin & Co had a band; they would be called â€Boss Bitchesâ€™ (lol) and Rowan + Aedion would be the backup rappers
-If Rowan had a twitter handle; it would be generic and he would never use it; but Aedion would post at him just to annoy him
-Aelin would be the queen of selfies
-Advice to writers â€“ never give up!
(Iâ€™ll add more as I remember them!)
Overall; I really loved it. There were large portions of world building that slowed down the pacing; so go into this expecting a different type of book. Sarah really excels when she writes stories of emotional healing. I really appreciated so many aspects of Tower of Dawn and it will remain dear to my heart. Iâ€™m honored to have had the chance to talk to her face to face; to get to know the woman behind the book â€“ the woman who went out of her way to befriend me amidst a big event with swarms of people; to share her story and why she wrote it that way.
Lastly; I attribute much of my own emotional healing through faith and my relationship with Christ; and while this story isnâ€™t a religious one; Sarah was 100% right about the emphasis on outlook and forgiving yourself/others. I just loved all the positive reinforcement and encouragement in this book. So I leave you with this: Everyone makes mistakes and everyone can improve; and what you do going forward shows your true character. And no matter who you are or what you are going through; no matter what you are physically capable of doing or not doing; you are valuable.

Pre Review:
I'm actually hoping he doesn't get healed. Having a disability rep in this series would be pretty incredible. Imagine Chaol overcoming and kicking ass despite it.

Maas,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3433047.Sarah_J_Maas,Fantasy; Young Adult; New Adult; Romance,Emily May,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1528390751p2/4622890.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,"Eh. It was all right. But it's kind of hard to tear apart the personality of a beloved character; turn them into someone whiny and bland; then try to create a whole 672-page book out of their perspective. It wasn't awful; but many parts were boring.
I overlook a lot when it comes to Maas. The poor representation of marginalized characters; the frankly creepy obsession with ""manhood"" and ""maleness""; the nauseating and repeated descriptions of characters' beauty... but here I thought the story really lacked something. You can sum Tower of Dawn up as an overlong healing process with a love story. The romance is predictable; and I'll spoiler tag it but it should come as a surprise to no one that Chaol (view spoiler).
The events of this book occur alongside the events of Empire of Storms; filling in the blanks of Chaol's adventures on the Southern continent. Chaol goes to appeal to the rulers and healers of Antica - for the former to ally with Dorian; and the latter to heal him and help him walk again. Though the powerful healer - Yrene - seems to hate Chaol at first; we know this is a Maas book; so he can only be shirtless so long before she starts falling for him.
A subplot emerges with healers being murdered in crimes that look suspiciously like the actions of the Valg; and yet from the beginning through to the very end of this looonnnggg book; it felt like what it was: a mere distraction between the Chaol and Yrene love/hate flirtations. As the book drew to a close; it was easy to see that Tower of Dawn existed for the sole purpose of creating a new love interest for Chaol and getting him back on his feet. Literally.
Perhaps this was a case of poor timing; perhaps there was just less tension knowing the last book left us chronologically after the end of this book's events. We're reading in the past with Tower of Dawn when Empire of Storms left us on such a delicious high; wanting to know what would happen to Aelin. I think it was a bad decision to insert Chaol's 600+ page perspective here; right when Maas has us on an emotional hook. I feel like by the time the next book rolls around; excitement and tension over Aelin's predicament will have waned for me.
Maas has responded to readers; or so it seems; by creating more diverse characters in this book. Many of the secondary characters are POC; and a major side character is queer. Though she still seems genuinely clueless when handling interactions between them; putting emphasis on Yrene's shock when Chaol smiles at the female healers AND *gasp* the male guards. Oh my; gay people! How crazy! And that's not even saying anything about the way Chaol's disability is handled...
Mostly; it just wasn't that fun. Either Chaol and Yrene were predictably ogling each other; or else Chaol was concentrating on wiggling his big toe like he's the less badass version of Beatrix Kiddo. It would be more fun if we turned it into a drinking game:
Drink every time Chaolâ€™s â€œmanhoodâ€ is mentioned.
Drink every time Chaolâ€™s eyes ""smolder"".
But; alas; I am pregnant and therefore disappointingly sober.

I have not liked Chaol since the second half of the Crown of Midnight. Also with the last book finishing with Aelin in such a precarious position I personally did not want to wait an extra year to find out what happened to her.
However SJM knows best; every issue I had with Chaol was address in this book. Also if this book would have come out after the next the final book this story would have had the prequel curse where I would have known everything that was going to happen.
I admit I was thinking about Aelin through this book; so I was glad to see her make appearances (only as mentions throughout). This is a great story tying up threads from former books and novellas. I think the â€œnothing is coincidenceâ€ is featured and shown perfectly in this book.
This is a great story about redemption; character development/growth; using left over bits from the other stories to make a great story; and characters finding their own place. Once again it the it is a great credit to SJMâ€™s storytelling skills that she wrote such a great book essentially just the side characters; and made them shine. Especially Nesryn who definitely deserved better then just being Chaolâ€™s backup (in more ways then one). There is also great description about the mental aspect of physical injury recovery; and how much of the process is mental. Anger; frustration; and guilt can be as detrimental to a personâ€™s recovery as the cause of the physical injury itself.
As much as I hate to admit it these characters would not have had a chance to shine like this if Aelin was in this book. If possible this book has increased my anticipation for the next book even more. I canâ€™t wait for the final book of this great series. I am expecting all out WAR; and one hell of a retribution beat downs to all the Vargs. (less)",183,NEXTBOOK

Tower of Dawn is my second favorite book that Sarah J. Maas has ever written! And it is; hands down; the best installment in the Throne of Glass series; in my honest opinion. I completely and wholeheartedly loved it. This is easily one of the best books Iâ€™ve read in 2017.
The first part of this review is spoiler free for Tower of Dawn; but it does have minor spoilers for the rest of the Throne of Glass series!
Also; before I even start this review; I just want to say that I actually think Sarah has been listening to her readers and this book truly proves it. First off; we have a very predominant queer side character; who clearly states this from the beginning and is written very believably and seamlessly. Next; we have a full diverse cast of characters; besides Chaol; in this novel. And lastly; and the thing I was most concerned about going into this book; Sarah respectfully writes about Chaolâ€™s disability; without ever making it seem like he must be ""fixed"" in order to have self-worth. (But please be aware that this review is coming to you from a white; able-bodied woman; so I am not the voice you should be listening to for the last two representations.)
I also think Sarah unfortunately listened to the backlash about her â€œyoung adultâ€ books having so much sex in them; because there is totally less sex in this book than in EoS; ACOMAF; and ACOWAR. There is still amazing angst and build up to sex; and there is one actual sex scene; but nothing near as graphic or even as descriptive as her previous works. Me; being the perverted person that I am; was a little disappointed by this; especially with how much I love Chaol.
I should also preface this review by telling those of you who do not know that Chaol is my favorite character in ToG; well; besides my queen; Manon Blackbeak! Iâ€™ve never been the biggest fan of Celaena/Aelin; and I think this story (and the rating I gave it) probably really benefited from that.
The last thing I will say before I actually start this long-winded review is that I cannot stress enough how important it is to read The Assassin and the Healer novella from the novella bind up; The Assassin's Blade; before you read this book!
Tower of Dawn is a story that is running parallel with the events that took place in Empire of Storms. While Aelin; Dorian; and the rest of the gang are trying to unite empires and bring them together to fight the greater threat at hand; Chaol and Nesryn left for Antica; located in the southern continent; to convince another strong empire to join them in the battle that is inevitably coming; while also seeing if the healers at the Torre can heal Chaolâ€™s paralysis.
Also; the southern continent is way more advanced than Erilea could ever hope to be. Magic is not only thriving here; but itâ€™s celebrated. And healing is one of the most prized powers of all. And one of the three points of view in this book; besides Chaol and Nesryn; is a very talented and powerful healer named Yrene Towers.
I would say the point of views are definitely equal seeming between the three; but there are two big story lines going on. The first being Chaolâ€™s healing; and how he is hurting a lot more than just physically. Chaol is struggling with his self-worth; but I believe heâ€™s also struggling with PTSD. He feels very guilty and that he is to blame for Aelin; Dorian; his family; his guardsmen; and also his disability. This book really showcases and highlights how mental pain and disabilities are just as hard to overcome as physically pain and disabilities; and Chaol for sure learns this lesson in true Chaol fashion: the hard way.
And the second storyline is a big mixture of different ways Chaol and Nesryn are trying to sway the current khagan; Urus; to their cause. Urus has six children and when he passes on one of them will rule; because in this kingdom it is not automatically given to the first-born heir. No one knows who the ruler will be; so this can make siblings rather blood thirty for one another; and once one is chosen to rule; the others must submit or things can get really bloody. This also makes the task of winning them all over a little difficult for Chaol and Nesryn.
â€œYour city is the greatest I have ever laid eyes upon; your empire the standard by which all others should be measured. When Morath comes to lay waste to it; who will stand with you if we are all carrion?â€
Urus' six children:
âž½Arghun - oldest child and enjoys power in knowledge.
âž½Sartaq - second oldest and commands the Rukhin riders.
âž½Hasar - third oldest and amazingly queer.
âž½Kashin - fourth oldest and most loyal.
âž½Duva - fifth oldest; who is married and carrying the first grandbaby right now.
âž½Tumelun - the baby; and the cause of an underlying mystery.
All of these side characters are very impactful to not only this book; but the greater arching story at hand; too. These characters also put a big emphasis on family for this story; and the amazing lengths we are willing to go for the people we love.
Tower of Dawn not only introduces a vast array of new characters; and it also helps showcase that this book feels like a love letter to being young and finding yourself. Yet also; finding what you truly want in your life. I mean; these characters are all in their early 20s; itâ€™s not plausible that they are all going to know what path they want to take; or that they all choose to take the path that was set for them by others. I love that this book realistically depicts that your first love wonâ€™t always be your last love; and how normal and okay that truly is. Finding yourself; and what you want from this life; is a truly beautiful story in and of itself.
There is a vast amount of world building and character development within these 700 pages; and I truly believe this is such a wonderful addition to this series. Before I get into the spoiler section; I will say that there are trigger warnings for talk of suicide; grey area cheating; war themes; and violence. I will also say that the epilogue of this book will probably shatter your soul. Like; is it Fall of 2018 yet? But I loved this and it was such a wonderful and important installment in the Throne of Glass series.
The rest of my review is going to contain MAJOR SPOILERS for both ALL the books leading up to this book; and for Tower of Dawn itself! Please; do not proceed to read any further unless you have read this book and its predecessors or you wish to be spoiled!
â€œThe heart heâ€™d offered and had been left to drop on the wooden planks of the river docks. An assassin who had sailed away and a queen who had returned.â€
Okay; so I think Iâ€™m just going to do little (and probably incoherent) paragraph gushes about things and how I felt about certain things in this book; because I just have too many emotions right now!
â€œNo matter the oceans; or mountains; or forests in the way.â€
I guess we should probably start off talking about how Sarah J. Maas does what she always does; but somehow always ends up surprising me. I honestly thought this book was going to have a romance about Chaol and Nesryn; so when she pulled the rug out from under my feet and made it really apparent that Chaol and Nesryn were going to not only not be together; but also have new budding romances with other people; I was completely shocked.
I; personally; never liked Chaol and Nesryn together. I always thought that it was terrible writing on Sarahâ€™s part to even force them together. I thought it was so unbelievable and just another way to show how Aelin and Rowan were soulmates; and it just felt bad to me. So; I was beyond elated to see their outcome work out differently than I expected.
â€œYrene pushed down on the handle. And Chaol took a step toward her.â€
This quote defeated me. When Chaol finally stood up and then walked to Yreneâ€¦ I was weeping. Like; tears; sniffling; heavy breathing; hell; I was ugly crying; letâ€™s be real. This was my favorite moment in this entire book and I was a complete and utter mess.
â€œYou looked at me without an ounce of pity. You saw me. Not the chair or the injury. You saw me. It was the first time Iâ€™d felt â€¦ seen. Felt awake; in a long time.â€
I loved how Sarah handled Chaolâ€™s disability; and how even though he is able to walk a lot of the time; he also isnâ€™t completely healed. I was really concerned going into this book; that this was going to be a bad feeling ""fix""; so an able-bodied Chaol could come back into the main storyline; but instead it truly was a story about Chaol coming to terms with his disability and accepting himself and his life; wheelchair; cane; or standing on his own two feet.
â€œI might not have battled kings and shattered castles [â€¦] but I am the heir apparent to the Healer on High. Through my own work and suffering and sacrifice. And youâ€™re standing right now because of that. People are alive because of that. So I may not be a warrior waving a sword about; may not be worthy of your glorious tales; but at least I save livesâ€”not end them.â€
And Yrene is such a amazing character. Seeing her refusing to ever be a victim again; while also teaching lots of young girls how to defend themselves; was one of my favorite plot lines Sarah J Maas has ever written. I loved the tie in with The Assassin and the Healer; and I am very much anticipating the reunion between her and Aelin. Also; Chaol crying over his fate and that piece of paper? Lord; help me.
â€œI loved you before I ever set eyes on youâ€
I actually really enjoyed the romance between Nesryn and Sartaq; too; I just was really disappointed that we didnâ€™t also get to have a sex scene between them; as horrible as that sounds! Sartaq has some of the most romantic one liners I have ever read in my entire life. Like; he has me swooning from the very beginning; and I canâ€™t wait to read more about him and the rest of the Ruk riders. Also; the whole storyline with the Ruks very much reminded me of Valynâ€™s storyline in the Chronicle of the Unhewn Throne; which is one of my favorite series of all time; and I completely loved it. Give me all the warrior birds and their warrior riders; please.
And Borte; Yeran; Houlun; and Falkan were all amazing side characters; too! And the plot twist with Falkan searching for Lysandra made my entire year. That; too; will be such an amazing reunion that I canâ€™t wait to read about.
And Nesrynâ€™s storyline was really important to me too. I was very happy she wasnâ€™t overshadowed by Chaol and Yrene. I also loved that she acknowledged that she refused to be used and be a rebound to Chaol. As much as I felt bad for Chaol; because of Aelin; Nesyrn is the only true victim in this. Iâ€™m also happy that she seeked out her own happiness; even without knowing that Chaol and Yrene had feelings for each other. I hope young SJM fans read this; and realize they are all worth someone who unconditionally loves them; and an impulsive ride on a Ruk.
â€œWe fly to war. Much is uncertain ahead. Save for this.â€ He brushed his mouth against hers. â€œSave for what I feel for you. No demon army; no dark queen or king; will change that.â€
I mean; just when I thought we had all the Maeve surprises we were going to get from Empire of Storms; this book comes along and says; â€œhold my beer!â€ A Valg Queen? Talk about an amazing plot twist that I didnâ€™t see coming from a mile away! Also; the Stygian Spiders are terrifying; and I know their gate guarding is going to come back into play in a super crucial way and they are going to give me the major heebie-jeebies all over again!
Fireheart; the epilogue ending with Aelinâ€¦ be still; my heart. I honestly cannot wait for this final concluding novel. The ending of Empire of Storms was hard to read; and those two pages just brought back so many emotions.
Overall; if you couldnâ€™t guess from this gush of a review; I completely and wholeheartedly loved this. Again; this is my second favorite thing Sarah J. Maas has created; and I have nothing but the highest of hopes for everything she creates and for what she plans to do for the conclusions on this series. Also; she has set up the option for so many spinoffs with all of these amazing side characters she introduced in Tower of Dawn; but first they all have to survive this incoming war.
â€œMaybe you and I will have to learn how to liveâ€”if we survive this war.â€

(Donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll have a review for this one. I hate to promise and not provide and life is hectic. I just stress myself a lot about it; hope you donâ€™t mind. But this one is highly; highly recommended!)
***
Never been on Team Chaol. My precious cinnamon roll; Dorian Havilliard; stole my heart from the beginning. But I've always wondered: HOW ON EARTH CAN ANYONE NOT LOVE CHAOL?!?! Not for his relationship with Celaena; but just for who he is. Selfless; loyal; kind; courageous. I don't know about you; but the fact that he lost his shit in QoS (which was acceptable since he went against everything he believed in his whole life); the fact that he was flawed like any other human being only brought him closer to perfection.
So; no. I'm not sad that we get his book instead of the final novel. He deserves the recognition. SJM described this book as HoF (my favorite ToG installment) but for Chaol. It's gonna be a journey of healing and revelations and finding yourself again. PLUS THE SOUTHERN CONTINENT OMG. Plus Yrene Towers!! And NESRYN. It's gonna be amazing.

I was waiting on my special copies to get here. Yes; I got two.
This is my signed edition from Barnes and Noble with some extras at the back.
The one from Target has the special art inside.
Sooooooooooooooooo; I was going to give this 4 stars but it made the 5 stars because I have a new love and that would be Sartaq =) I really wish they would have had more scenes with him and Nesryn. I want to read more about them. But there is still the war so there is that and I love their Ruks!
I wasn't a fan of Chaol after someone was killed in another book and he... well it doesn't matter. I enjoyed this book about him good enough. I'm glad I read Assassin's Blade before this because some peeps were in this book.
I loved Yrene sooooooooooooo much too. She's a healer that was asked to help Chaol. It was a rough road with that because of things....
We find out some revelations!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! REVELATIONS! REVELATIONS! I love screaming that in a book. I didn't see that coming at all and now I'm worried about the last book. =( They better all live because it's going to me messed up with some wickedness.
There are some great characters in this book but it centers around Chaol; Yrene; Nesryn and Sartaq. But all of the other characters are great except for the evil ones but that is a given!
There was a happy ending and not so happy ending because of things to come. I did mention I'm worried right?

""You may look at me with resentment Yrene Towers; and I will not blame you for it. But believe me when I say there is no one in Erilea who loathes me more than I do myself.â€
I went into this without a ton of expectations but am really glad this book happened now! I was curious to see how Chaolâ€™s story would unfold; but also a bit wary that his character growth would be tied to his current disability being cured. Iâ€™ll talk more about that in a bit; but I thought everything worked really well in the end! I just love how much character development Maas takes the time to put into her stories because everything becomes 1000x more realistic and emotional. The story does take a bit to get moving; though; and I wasn't totally into it until about 1/4 of the way through. So hang in there...
Also; this didnâ€™t really feel like â€œChaolâ€™s bookâ€ to me because Nesryn and Yrene both have equally important stories and POVs. (Aaaand there's one more POV at the end that made me SO EMOTIONAL for all of 2 pages). So you donâ€™t necessarily need to read The Assassinâ€™s Blade before this; but I'd absolutely recommend reading this before the final Throne of Glass book. This isnâ€™t some side story. So many important things are revealed!
This story is basically a journey of finding hope and healing in different ways for so many characters. Chaol and Nesryn head to the southern continent to ask the khaganate to fight in the upcoming war and try to find someone to help Chaol be able to walk again after his spinal injury in Queen of Shadows. The Khagan has several children who are competing to be named his heir; two of whom become amazing new characters. Sartaq is a son who commands the rukhin (an aerial cavalry of archers who fly on giant birds and are going to be so badass if/when they meet up with The Thirteen). He takes Nesryn off on a bunch of adventures to see her homeland and their story has some pretty awesome moments. (Ok I wasn't exactly as into it as I wanted to be; but was still decently invested).
Yrene Towers (the healer from The Assassinâ€™s Blade) is also there working as a powerful healer. Sheâ€™s been teaching other girls the self-defense that Celaena taught her and still carries her note. Yrene learned to take control of her life; but still has to face the trauma of her past and heal emotionally etc. She agrees to try to heal the man who commanded Adarlanâ€™s soldiers even though she despises what he did while serving the king. The story really gets moving when they find out there's a Valg demon on the southern continent and it's hunting Yrene because of REASONS.
Meanwhile Chaol has been stewing in self-hatred and guilt over everything thatâ€™s happened in the past few books; soooo heâ€™s got some stuff to work through. He was painfully honorable and loyal to a fault; which blinded him to who/what he was really serving: a ""man controlled by a demon king hell-bent on turning this world into a feast for his hordes."" Anyone Chaol had tried to help ended up suffering. All of the men he was responsible for ended up being tortured and hung from the castle gates. He had run and left Dorian to face the king. Everything he had ever planned for or wanted is now gone.
But before Yrene can even address the injury to his spine they have to get through the residual valg demon stuff thatâ€™s there. That thing keeps trying to drag him down into the darkness by showing him everyone he left and failed (kind of like when the valg possessed Dorian); so he has to confront all of that in order to let Yrene get through to work on his spine.
Chaolâ€™s healing felt a lot like Aelinâ€™s story in Heir of Fire with how she had to really break and face everything she was before she could rebuild herself and move forward with a purpose. He has to choose whether to stay in that darkness and give it power or to forgive himself and ""fill it with better things."" This whole part was SO powerful. I don't even know where to begin with the quotes; so I'll just say I think a ton of people will be able to relate to Chaol's journey. There were some truly inspiring & relatable insights I'm just super grateful for. I was also glad he had a chance to let himself process everything with Aelinâ€¦ and seeing his total devotion to Dorian was so sweet.
Basically; the story hit every part of the healing that was necessary to get Chaolâ€™s character mentally back in the same fight as everyone else. In the previous books he was a confused; lost character who was starting to not fit in with the flow of the rest of the story for me because he wasn't sure what he was for. Now he's an equal player in the war to come and has a clear purpose. Chaol learns to find a new way through life and his entire take on his â€œdisabilityâ€ is transformed along with his self-worth/image. (So; no; this isnâ€™t a manual of how someone should view a disability right from the start; but rather what felt like a flawed human's realistic struggle to come to terms with one of many sudden changes in his life and identity).
(view spoiler)
Random things I loved:
- almost every character is a POC
- more insights into events from previous books (like the King of Adarlanâ€™s actions)
- most characters are in their twenties
- every single character isnâ€™t straight or super attractive
- seeing a broader worldview with news from other locations
- I was getting a lot of Game of Thrones vibes at times; which made it even more fun. Empire of Storms was super LOTR for me and I loved that.
- learning more fae history
- how the â€œget upâ€ thing came back to Chaol
- ALL THE SHIPS. so many ships omg
I just really loved how the story took the time to really get into some history and worldbuilding that strengthened the series SO MUCH. I mean; all of the stuff with the wyrdgates and keys and Valg princes was interesting before; but never seemed totally cohesive to me. It felt like there was some piece missing before the final battle could be properly established; so this book was totally what I needed. Now the war has weight; context; and a solid threat with history yay. I actually kind of screamed out loud at 81% because that was a brilliant shift in the direction of this series.
Maas said she put in a ton of time with sensitivity readers to make sure her rep in this book was solid and you can feel how much care and effort she put into this. I'm curious to hear from others who use wheelchairs and have read this story. Everyone's experience is different (so this obviously this won't be universally applicable and I'm not speaking for anyone else but myself); but I really related to Chaol's mindset and the whole evolution he went through there. I've been relying on a wheelchair for several years now and can only stand occasionally; so it was just incredibly inspiring to see a character I admire go through something so similar (ok Lyme attacking the nervous system & joints is a bit different BUT you know what I mean). I really can't articulate how much I connected with some scenes... I have read so many fantasy books and have never found a central character like this. I was super hesitant (and somewhat skeptical) going into this book; but just want to hug it now. I think Maas has always done an amazing job writing raw healing journeys and I'm SO grateful Chaol's story went in the direction it did!!
In the end; this was a powerful story of several characters finding themselves; hope; and a future to fight for as they prepare for the war. I mostly appreciated that this book did so much to help set the stage for the next book. Some of the events here definitely felt like padding for a novella that was turned into a full length novel; so this isn't my favorite Throne of Glass book. But I still enjoyed it and wish there could be a few more books with these new characters and locations! I loved them all and cannot wait to see all of the fan art you talented bookworms create. <3

I took the night to visit my parents.""
[Chaol] tried not to cringe. A family. [Kadja] had family here; and he'd never bothered to ask--
You may as well pick up your bows and your quivers; because being shot in the vagina with a poisoned arrow would probably be less painful than reading one more page of Chaol's Boring Journey to God Knows Where With Fuck Knows Who Doing Who Fucking Cares. Bonus points for the chapters; many of which I skimmed like no woman has ever skimmed before; detailing Nesryn's Boring Journey to Some Fucking Mountains With Some Dude and The Spider I Vacuumed Up Last Week.
Honest to god; guys; this book was so boring I nearly died reading it. The hell happened? I'm hardly the biggest fan of the one with Feyre and Rhysand and all of their strange chiseled friends; but at least it held my attention. I low key went into cardiac arrest trying to get through this. The kicker is this: both Empire of Storms and Tower of Dawn were boring and full of fillers. The obvious solution should have been to smoosh them together into one book; but... $$$ I guess. That's just kind of sad.
The basic premise is this: Chaol goes to Antica to rally support for Aelin*. Okay; so we can work with that. But what we ended up with was just loads of stuff just straight up stolen from Game of Thrones! I mean; come on - Chaol is Hand of the King! Hand of the King is a title invented by George R. R. Martin. ""Hand of the King"" was never a title held by any historical figure. It's literally just stolen. There's no getting away from it.
*Aelin is going to be a shit queen. I just can't get past it. Does she know how to manage money or land or diplomacy? Course not! She just enjoys burning people. Get her some wildfire because she's basically just Cersei without all of those sad inbred children and her brother naked in her bed. Yikes!
Before this book; I actually really liked Chaol. I also sympathised with him; given that everyone took him for granted; and he went so far above his pay grade it's not even funny; just to be scorned by all and sundry for running away when an actual demon was trying to shear him in half with otherworldly magic. I still don't get why everyone has this weird attitude to him but I banged on about that for long enough in my review of Queen of Shadows so I won't bore you all with it now.
After Tower of Dawn; I'm not sick of Chaol for the same reasons that most people attest to: I've heard a lot of folk saying they hate him now because of the way he treated Nesryn. Nesryn dumped him via a note - actually; nah. I bet it was really a napkin; just thrown down on his dresser. Literally just Cho; I'm sick of you; don't call me; kthxbye and that's that. That's like Ye Olde Break Up Text. Truth be told; they were barely together to begin with. But that's not even the crux of the matter: I just hate Nesryn because she's so boring. Words can't even explain how little I care about her. She could have made like me the first 637658386 times I played Minecraft and tried to dig straight down (don't do that!!!!) and ended up in a lava pit; and I wouldn't have given a tiny rat's ass. I cared even less about her than I did about that bit at the beginning of Fallout; when you have to pretend to be devastated that your wife got shot and your baby got kidnapped; when really you're just waiting with bated breath to charge into battle #mwi on chems and make sweet gay love to that hot creep Hancock (there's no wrong way to play!).
Speaking of gay... I thought Chaol was queer? Did no one else think that? See; this is another missed opportunity. There's Hasar and Renia; though Hasar is a total arsehole and Renia is this weird wet rag of a character who keeps being referred to ickily as Hasar's ""lover"". I was feeling it between Chaol and Shen more than I ever felt it between Chaol and Yrene; and this is the problem with SJM: she has this weird ability to unknowingly write pairings with great chemistry; most of which are non-hetero; and then blow a big dumb hole right through it with the same enemies-to-lovers straight romance that we've seen six trillion times before. I always felt that Yrene's story was the least interesting part of The Assassin's Blade; and now I've got to sit here and pretend to buy her romance with Chaol? Are you trifling with this?
So one of the biggest problems I had with this book was Yrene; and not because she's the same crap character that we've seen a thousand times before - I've come to expect that. The worst part was that she is the shittest healer ever. The most unprofessional; the most rude; the most entitled. I have a high tolerance for fuckery; especially with high fantasy; but the scene where she allowed those little bitches to tear Chaol down off his horse and then trot him out like a wooden doll; as if; as a disabled person; he's just a thing to be toyed with; turned my fucking stomach. Then; after this; the Healer on High wafts over to Chaol with a sickly wee smile on her face and says; ""Welp; that's our Yrene. Don't be mean to her. She's had a hard life."" Fuck that. Fuck all of them; for treating Chaol in that way. It was disgusting. And then they have a little argument about it; and it's all forgotten about. Seriously? No. I literally couldn't stop thinking about that. We keep being told that Yrene is so talented and amazing and the next heir to the Torre Cesme; and yet she is still at the stage where she's treating her patients like this? Where the hell is her bedside manner?
(I'm also pretty pissed off about Chaol being healed in the end; and the cop-out with the life bond to Yrene; but that's a given. Why we can't just have a handsome male character with a rounded story arc who is just straight up in a wheelchair; disabled; is a mystery to me. There is no reason why Chaol needed to be magically healed. I'm so sick of this cast of Olympians with their rippling muscles and their perfect swordplay; and this is another reason why it's relevant to note Game of Thrones: it has its issues with representation; absolutely; but it is notable in its portrayal of multiple well-rounded and layered disabled characters.)
The trouble is that the setting of Antica was cool...but derivative. The idea was good...but executed badly. This book was full of good ideas that went down the toilet; and I'm kind of pissed off about it; because this is the sixth book; and it certainly wasn't cheap; but it's not the money I'm bitter about. It's the fact that I've committed to this series and these characters; and SJM won't stop butchering them. This series was so; so promising; and I used to love it so passionately; and now it's shite. Not to sound like Disgrunted 4chan Fan #67546453; but how is that fair? Don't build up fans' expectations; then then disrespect the first three (excellent) books in the series with this piece of nonsense. I know what happened here: A Court of Stuff took up too much time; which left this to be skittered out in a few weeks then hastily edited and printed just to make a bag of Ye Olde Coin. I'm not buying it. Well; I did buy it; the absolute weapon that I am; but you know what I mean.
Needless to say; this did not need to be 660 pages long. It should have been part of EOS; or at the very least; a small boring novella that wasn't required reading. If it had been a novella; we could have swiftly avoided the absolutely abhorrent pro-life thing at the end; which was dizzyingly crap; a total piss-take. Honestly; the final scene with Duva beggars belief. It is shockingly terrible. There's this constant internal battle between Chaol and Yrene; both of them wanting to kill Duva to get rid of the demon in her; but they're like; ""no! She's pregnant! What about the child!"" Can you GET to fuck? I just... It has to be seen to be believed. Duva is getting thrown around; all of her agency gone; this poor woman forced to kill her own sister; and all Chaol and Yrene are worried about is the fucking unborn mass of cells inside her. ""He wouldn't so much as harm Duva; not with that baby in her womb"" (610). So he'd have been fine to gut her without it? The only reason he stays his blade is because she's pregnant? It was actually kind of disgusting to read. I hated it. I hated that Duva's own full; cultivated; adult life was seen as expendable; but god forbid the unborn fetus inside her come to harm! That attitude disgusts me. It's literal filth. I can't believe I read this with my own two eyes.
I could bang on and on about this for hours; but let's just say this: the quality of these books has taken a very; very sharp decline. So sharp it could kill a man. Or a woman; except when she's with child. Because only then is her life apparently worth something. (less)",191,NEXTBOOK

THIS SERIES IS LIFE! SARAH J MAAS IS LIFE! ­
Thanks to my babe Lena for making this reading experience extra amazing! Always going to have fond memories attached to it now! <3
I mean; 5 Œ of course! Are we surprised? What else would it be?! SJM; my queen of everything.
I just want to curl up in a ball; stay in a cave somewhere till the last book comes out. Last page? Fuckin sadistic move! ©
There's so much that's happening in this overall story of Aelin and her court! (I get so psyched when I say that! Boss woman!) So much that needs resolving and I don't know how Sarah J Maas will wrap it up. Especially with the new revelations brought to light. I mean; can I get a WTF? One thing I can rely on though is that she always delivers for me.
Chaol as a character since the beginning of this series has been one of my favorites. Before my obsession with Rowan or Aelin or Dorian even. He was the one I instantly warmed to and cared for. And his overall character arc from book one till now has been an incredible and healing journey to follow. I adore him! Flaws and all!
I'm so damn happy this turned out to be an actual novel. Chaol needed it. He deserved it. I still get pissy and when I read that people believe; or assume shall we say because that is what they're doing; that Sarah J Maas has no care for Chaol. No; I want to laugh. It's pathetic. Childish. His story would never have worked in Empire of Storms. Simply because; a 1000 page YA fantasy book just doesn't get published. He got the respect and the attention through this book. His own story and journey that completes and adds so much more to what Sarah J Maas has planned for the next book.
I can't wait to see the role of each character. The reunion; people!!!! At times; I felt that the plot was quite... simplistic. For what I thought to be such a complicated matter; the answers or the outcomes for a particular plot line did not completely satisfy me. It's my only qualm. Other than that; this series safely sits alongside my Potter collection as one of my all-time favourite series. Books!
(view spoiler)
PRE-RELEASE RANTS AND THOUGHTS!
Am I the only one that thinks that people are getting way; way; waaaaaaaay to sensitive and emotional about this cover now? It's Chaol's fuckin' face that just missing. That's it. To insinuate that SJM has no care for HER CHARACTER is so stupid; I don't even know where to begin. We're getting a fully-fledged fuckin' (note: alliteration!) novel; that was meant to be a novella initially. People need to pipe down those emotions! *rolls eyes*
20/06/2017 â€” WE HAVE THE COVER!! And I'm not psyched about it at all. ’ Pretty sure Bloomsbury and Maas's people could've done a better job... Why could they have not just followed the theme of the other books and have Chaol on the cover instead?! ‘ I don't care what that dumb shield signifies; give me Chaol! ¤ #frustrated
Not doubting that the story will deliver though!

Original review:
I. Am. In. Tears.
I was originally not at all excited for this book but then I reread the entire series and I was HYPED. This book didn't let me down at all. Not one bit. I'm shook to the max by how much I utterly love this book. I was in no way ready for everything that happened in this book and I'm blown away by all of the twists and turns that occurred.
We all knew that Chaol's job was to get healed as well as raise an army. Honestly; the way Chaol's healing took place was so utterly raw and incredible. I think it was absolutely perfect where he ended up and I don't think Sarah could have done any better than this. This book is incredible perfection and I am in love.
As someone who didn't like Chaol and slowly grew to like him in my reread; I would like to say that I love Chaol. That is all. (less)",193,NEXTBOOK

I absolutely could not wait to get my hands on it. I am a goner for this series!
After the way things left off at the end of the fifth book; I was sure that this book would pick up where it had ended. I expected to dive right back into Celaena's current predicament and have a front row seat as she managed to battle her way out of captivity. That didn't happen.
This book was not the book that I thought I'd be getting. That isn't to say that it was a let down though; it wasn't. It just wasn't at all what I was expecting.
'Tower of Dawn' explores an entirely different aspect of this complex story. This book focuses on Chaol and his exploration of the Southern Continent. Not what I anticipated...but still fantastic.
Let me be upfront about the fact that I was not the biggest fan of Chaol. In fact; over the past few books I had grown to detest him. He is a character that went from being a favorite of mine to one that I loathed. I wasn't sure that there would ever be any redemption for him.
Incredibly; Sarah J. Maas has managed to work Chaol back into my good graces with this book. I wouldn't have believed it was possible; but she made it happen. This book showed a softer; more vulnerable side of Chaol. I even felt bad for him at times. Little by little; I found myself warming back up to him and understanding why he did some of the things that he did before.
Horribly wounded; Chaol and Nesryn seek out the legendary healers of Torre Cesme in Antica. If anyone can cure Chaol of his paralysis; they will be found here. However; his mission is two-fold. He hopes to also gain additional support for the campaign in the North.
Begrudgingly; Yrene is tasked with healing Chaol. It will be her greatest achievement; if she can overcome her deep-rooted hatred for Chaol and the kingdom that he represents. Yrene suffered greatly as a result of the King that Chaol fought for. She's faced with an ethical dilemma of epic proportions.
The two eventually strike up an unlikely friendship. While the memory of what Chaol represents is never far from Yrene's mind; she finds herself seeing him as more man and less monster as time passes. Their relationship grows slowly and steadily; each trying to hold back their feelings until it eventually becomes impossible.
As Chaol begins to heal; he starts questioning what he really wants. He feels remorse and shame for some of his past actions. With Yrene; he finds forgiveness and revived humanity.
Of course; it wouldn't be a 'Throne of Glass' book if there wasn't plenty of danger and action. There was no shortage of adventure and heart-stopping situations. Expect a strong dose of the supernatural. Around every turn was the possibility of destruction as this battle between good and evil continues.
My only disappointment was that I was dying to pick up where the last book left off. Unfortunately; I am still in the dark; along with a million other readers. Aside from a few very brief mentions at the very end of this book; Celaena; Rowan and Dorian are noticeably absent from this book. We'll all have to wait for the next one to get our questions answered.
Even so; I found myself completely lost in this book. It was worth every minute. I listened to the Audible edition and it was fabulous. Honestly; if I weren't so bitter about the fact that I'm still left in the dark about Celaena's fate; I'd probably say this was a 5-star read. I spent a lot of time waiting for her to make an appearance before finally realizing that it wasn't going to happen and just enjoying the beauty of this book for what it was.

Tower of Dawn was everything I wanted; even though I was not aware of it before the first chapters. A Court of Mist and Fury inflicted some serious damage to my relationship with Sarah J. Maas due to severe character mistreatment; shameless manipulation and a shrine built for Saint Rhysand; but this one restored my faith in her. Before reading Tower of Dawn I was furious for the delay in Throne of Glass' conclusion. For another change of ships I knew would come. I decided to dive into it for the sake of continuing the story; as if it was an unpleasant task I had to get over with. I never expected to be this invested in the new characters. I never expected the frantic heartbeat; the way my chest exploded. And I ended up full of gratitude and a little awe in front of the miracle; the wondrous feeling of finding a little gem; a flare of magic where you least expected it.
â€œHe was Lord of Nothing. Lord of Oath-Breakers. Lord of Liars.â€
Tower of Dawn follows Chaol and Nesryn's journey to the southern continent; in order to search for potential allies against the forces of Morath and a way to heal Chaol after the events of Queen of Shadows. In a foreign land; a place thriving and actually cared for by its monarchs; Chaol was forced to face the demons within; along with the court manipulations and the political games between the viziers and the possible heirs of the khaganate. There he met Yrene Towers; an unwilling Healer hating Adarlan and everything Chaol represented with a seething passion; but for reasons unknown to him decided to help him nonetheless. Nesryn; on the other hand; was restless. Even though she finally found a place to blend in despite her mixed heritage; she craved the adventure Chaol promised her but never delivered. And so; she set off on an adventure of her own. On the back of a ruk; she battled horrendous beings and came across secrets that could alter the outcome of the war to end all wars. In the city of Antica; where the Tower of Healers blessed by the Goddess loomed; in the unforgiving mountains of the famous ruk riders; Chaol and Nesryn found answers; even to questions they never dared ask.
â€œFor wherever you need to go - and then some. The world needs more healers. â€
Healing. That's what Chaol needed; for his broken body and his broken soul; ravaged by the guilt and self-loathing that festered inside him. And Sarah; the wonderful and terrible Sarah; gave them to him. I always thought that his relationship with Aelin was not treated smoothly; that in her desperate need to make Rowan/Aelin happen; the author decided to sacrifice him. To be honest; though; I never turned against him. I just wanted Sarah to restore this beautiful; flawed character who gave up everything; his title; his honour; his men; and ended up feeling like a total waste; a disappointment and a pathetic excuse of a human being. The portayal of his inner thoughts; the broken pieces of him; was spectacular; and so was the depiction of disability; and how the emotional trauma; the constant feeling of incompetence; can wreck more havoc than the physical wound itself. I ached for him. For his trials; for his demons; for everything. His stay in the southern continent was a much-needed journey of redemption; and in the end I felt purified. Ready to conquer the world; fight the horrors of Morath and Erawan by his side. It was invigorating.
â€œHe had made one promise. He had not broken it yet.
To save them.
His friend; his kingdom.
He still had that.
Even here at the bottom of this dark hell; he still had that.â€
But Chaol was not the only one who needed to find himself. Yrene Towers; the young healer Aelin helped a lifetime ago; came to play a vital part. At first I was so angry at her; for being blind with rage and grief and failing to see that Chaol was not the one who took everything from her; that the same nation can breed both bad and good men. But as the story progressed; and her walls started crumbling; I loved the person that emerged. Her bravery; her devotion; her compassion. I keep saying that Sarah never fails to create imperfectly perfect male characters (except Rhysand; the One-Who-Makes-Mountains-Tremble); but her female characters are fantastic as well. They're badass; truly badass; and strong despite the impediments they keep facing. Nesryn is another example; and she proved again and again how brave and brilliant she is. The way her relationship with Chaol unfolded was; thankfully; well-handled; and she shone as an independent person; without Chaol's influence.
â€œI wish we'd had time.â€
The characters introduced for the first time in Tower of Dawn were deeply intriguing; but there was one that made the others pale compared to him. Shartaq. Let's take a moment to admire the Winged Prince; who's a soft marshmallow and a fierce warrior at the same time. New crush alert; people; new crush alert (don't worry Dorian; you're still my number one bae)
The feelings evoked while reading Tower of Dawn were all-encompassing; and I cried so many times I lost count. Tears of joy; sorrow; pain and relief stained my face; especially in the last chapters (and; to be honest; every time Chaol remembered or talked about Dorian; his brother; his king - his loyalty and love towards Dorian made my heart swell). The descriptions were vivid; and everything related to the khaganate; the history; the culture; the court intrigue; was fascinating; the new world was richly painted. I felt the freedom of riding on a ruk; and wandered in lush palaces full of spying servants and scheming nobles; grieving for a princess who was lost so young and rooting for the next heir of a prosperous kingdom. The revelations about the Valg; and the secrets contained in libraries and tombs set the road for an explosive final book. But as it's slowly sinking in how much I'll have to wait for the last instalment of the series I cherish; a series
â€œI will cherish always.
No matter what may befall the world.
No matter the oceans; or mountains; or forests in the way.â€
I think I'm on the verge of depression.
If you have any doubts about reading Tower of Dawn; get over yourselves and read it. You won't regret it.

Wow. Wow. I'm actually speechless! This book was everything I needed and more and I have no clue how to write this review because I have so much to say and my thoughts are actually still all over the place. I have so much love for this book my heart's going to burst.
If you know me; you know I love Chaol Westfall to bits and pieces and he's one of my all-time favorite male characters. And here's where I get all emotional about him. I've loved him ever since ToG and still loved him through everything he went through. I would defend him to my last breath and I would fight anyone who insults him. Chaol is a pure soul. He's loyal. He's honorable. He's strong. He's brave. He's human. He's flawed. He's real. All of the things he went through from ToG to QoS changed him as a person and the way he dealt with things was completely realistic. Yes; he made his own mistakes; but again; that makes him real. Don't you always complain about needing realistic; flawed characters? Chaol Westfall is one. Chaol Westfall deserves all that's good and beautiful in this world. Thank you.
With the events of ToG till QoS; it all broke Chaol. Tower of Dawn did not only serve as a book where Chaol seeks healing and hopes to get more allies; but also it was his emotional journey. He was so broken at the beginning of the book. Filled with despair and self loathing. He learns to forgive himself. By the end of the book; he's come to terms with a lot of things and he rebuilds himself all over again. He has hope by the end of the book. He's no longer drowning in guilt and self loathing. And I was honestly in tears throughout the majority of the book because Chaol's emotional journey hit me. It was so intense and real and raw and I applaud SJM for doing it so realistically and so beautifully! I've said it a million times before and here I am saying it again; nobody does broken characters and healing like SJM does! The healing process was more of less similar to Celaena's in HoF and Feyre's in ACOMAF and personally; I think it was even more emotional. I've been waiting for Chaol to find happiness and peace since CoM and he finally did in this book and oh lord; I want to cry tears of joy all over again.
In this book; we see Yrene Towers again. For those who don't know her previously; she's a character that appeared in one of the novellas of The Assassin's Blade. Yrene is a main character in this book and while I was very neutral about her at first; I slowly loved her as the book progressed. Nesryn Faliq is also a main character in this book and she had her own plot which revealed loads of things! I was quite worried about Nesryn's character because she was introduced as a minor character within Chaol's plot. But in this book; no. Nesryn is her own character. We get to know so much about her and she has her own plot separate from Chaol's. We meet so many new side characters who are important too. My favorite side character is definitely Sartaq; one of the Khagan's children!
For those who think this book is ""not important""; well it is. It is super important. Loads of things happen. Loads of event the reader needs to know about happen. Information essential to the overall plot of the series was introduced in this book. So; yes. You need to read this book after EoS. So much history is revealed; history that is essential. History you need to know. So; no. This book is not a side story or a novella you can skip. It's a book you should read in order to understand whatever is coming next in ToG7.
Now... the ships. Oh dear God; the ships!! I'm not going to go into details because spoilers. But what I'll tell you is those ships will end you! It took me some time to accept some ships; but once I did; oooooh boy; the angst! I was swooning; I was screaming; I was also crying. Oh dear. Again; SJM's ships are always so beautiful!!!
Now; the disability rep. Beautiful; beautiful; beautiful. The care and hard work SJM put into this was so evident. Chaol learns to deal and accept his disability. Going from one state to another is never easy and it takes a toll on a person. Coming to terms with things is a long process. It's not a day and night thing. And that's exactly what Chaol goes through. I'm stressing again on Chaol's emotional journey and how real it was because it is so incredibly important and seeing Chaol heal and forgiving himself and coming to terms with so many things just really makes me super emotional all over again. I'm super attached to him so you can understand.
Tower of Dawn takes place in Antica; which is a new setting in the ToG universe. And for that reason; SJM had to spend some page time on world-building; which I personally loved. Her creativity and her sources of inspiration were evident and despite that this world-building made the book a tad slow; it was still essential and wonderful.
I feel like I've missed out on a lot of things I wanted to say. But that's all for now I guess. A lot of my thoughts are spoiler-y and I didn't want to add those in the review for now. This review will never do the book or the characters justice. This book is perfect and beautiful and real and painful and emotional and yes; a definite favorite of 2017 and also my favorite ToG book.
Update 20/June/2017: WE HAVE A COVER... and I'm not a fan.
It doesn't match the rest of the books and I just wanted the cover to have my precious baby Chaol on it. *sighs*
19/June/2017: GUYS GUYS GUYS.

identity crisis aside; â€kingdom of ashâ€™ comes out in two days and this has seriously got me hyped to the maxxx. the end is drawing nearer and my mind; body; and soul could not be more ready.
gahh. this book was so good. it was so different from the rest of the series; but i love that. it was so refreshing. also; its an unpopular opinion; i know; but i always have and always will love chaol. he has been my favourite since the very beginning and i will stand by him through thick and thin; at his best and at his worst (yeah; i see you guys coming for him during â€queen of shadowsâ€™ - not on my watch!). he is such a complex character - flawed; but also redeemable. and so it was about time he got a book of his own. i missed him so much in â€empire of storms;â€™ so this totally made up for his long absence.
in true SJM fashion; this delivered on the storytelling; the writing; the plot development; and the phenomenal characters. i loved how this was completely separate from the main series; but also tied in so well; giving the reader much needed information. i cant wait to see how what happened in this book will incorporate with everything else that has been going on in the series. but one thing is for sure; its about to all go down and none of us will make it out alive.

Despite the fact that this series has become one of my favorite series of all time (literally; itâ€™s now tied with two other series for my #1 favorite spot); I was extremely apprehensive about picking up this installment! Not only is it so close to the end (just one book left!); but it takes place from Chaolâ€™s perspective in the Southern Continent; and if youâ€™ve read my reviews of the other books in this series; you know Iâ€™m not his biggest fan.
â€œYou must enter where you fear to tread.â€
With that in mind; Iâ€™m not sure why I ever doubted Maasâ€™ ability to entertain me; because no amount of dislike for Chaol could have kept me from still enjoying this book quite a bit. While Chaol is incredibly angsty and self-loathing through most of the book; and that aspect of his personality gets old quickly; he also grows so much as a character and comes to recognize his own flaws and mistakes in a way that makes it hard not to forgive him. Heâ€™s still not winning Character of the Year awards from me any time soon; but I definitely donâ€™t hate him.
â€œUsing the chair is not a punishment. It is not a prison. It never was. And I am as much of a man in that chair; or with that cane; as I am standing on my feet.â€
Thereâ€™s also a lot to be said for his disability rep. Chaol begins the book hating his wheelchair and himself; but he grows to accept his new disability and begins to realize that itâ€™s going to hold him back from so much less than he thought it would. There are also a few discussions regarding how disabled individuals can feel like guinea pigs for physicians (healers); or how painful it is to be treated differently. I wonâ€™t promise this rep will work for every own-voice reader; but as someone who suffers from chronic pain and invisible disabilities; there were moments that actually made me cry because I felt so strongly understood by Chaolâ€™s representation.
It was like waking up or being born or falling out of the sky. It was an answer and a song; and she could not think or feel fast enough.
The real shining stars in this book; though; are Nesryn and Yrene. They are both such enjoyable characters; and I especially loved watching the way Nesryn came to life when she finally got to come home. Thereâ€™s a lot of talk about her feeling out of place at first; but she quickly comes to realize that sheâ€™s been welcomed into her homeland with open arms by almost everyone she meets; and it means so much to her that itâ€™s incredibly heart-warming. Theyâ€™re both strong-willed; independent women who could take on just about anything; whether itâ€™s through Nesrynâ€™s archery or Yreneâ€™s healing; and I cherished them both tremendously.
â€œI think she was a godâ€¦ I never learned her name. She only left a note with two lines. â€For wherever you need to goâ€”and then some. The world needs more healers.â€™â€
We also meet quite a few new characters in this installment; as well as seeing some old faces (this would be a good time to tell you that itâ€™s practically a requirement to read the Assassinâ€™s Blade novellas before picking up Tower of Dawn!). Iâ€™ve mentioned this before; but I am a sucker for storylines that rally together all of the older; minor characters in the end; and Maas does that beautifully in both Empire of Storms and in this book. I especially loved watching certain puzzle pieces fall into place for characters (as in the scene with Chaol and Yrene at the end of the book that literally made me weep over how much I love Aelin).
Some swore the cats had been caught pawing through the pages of open booksâ€”reading.
One thing I want to address; though; that made this a 4.5 instead of a solid 5 for me; is the fact that it was originally intended to be a novella; and then was almost 700 pages in the end. On the one hand; I do think this book is longer than it should beâ€”but on the other hand; a novella length wouldnâ€™t have fit everything in; either! I think something in the 450-500 page range would have been a much better length; but itâ€™s not a big complaint from me; as Iâ€™d always rather a book be a little too long than way too short and rushed.
This was not the end. This crack in him; this bottom; was not the end. He had one promise left.
And finally; because a lot of people have asked me in the few days since I finished reading this: is this book required reading for the series? YES. There are reveals in Tower of Dawn that are freaking HUGE for the series as a whole; plus there is so much character development that I honestly think you canâ€™t afford to miss it. If youâ€™re one of the series fans who simply refuses to read this; please; at least get a full-spoiler recap from someone! Thereâ€™s just too much to miss. (less)",204,NEXTBOOK

This is fighting for my favorite book in the series for so many reasons. Many because Sarah J Maas pulled a back-hand and showed her readers she had a plan all along for Chaol and she didnâ€™t just toss him aside like he was a wasted character.
I loved exploring the Southern continent and how their lands work. We have a powerful royals who have spontaneous and wicked personalities who are fighting for the throne; we have a tower of women (with some men) who specialize in healing and not fighting which is so important; we have library cats because yes that is something we all didnâ€™t know that we needed; we have giant spiders who are more deadly and animalistic than their northern sisters and absolutely something that I am terrified of yet want to know more about; and we have a huge twist that no one saw coming (and if you think you saw it coming; youâ€™re wrong).
I want to touch on the disability part in this book.
I thought it was wonderfully done.
I went to the release party that Sarah J Maas held in Nashville; Tennessee and she voiced that she spent months and months asking people how they do certain things with disabilities and watching videos on how things were done. She went that extra mile to not assume she would know how it would be done; but to ask people and to actually learn about that group of people.
I believe her research paid off in this book. I will say that Chaolâ€™s journey is a great one; and I am comparing this to the rest of the groupâ€™s journeyâ€™s here as well; but it isnâ€™t all daisies and puppies at the end (which I completely prefer because anyone can be a hero; as long as they want it badly enough). She ended Chaolâ€™s emotional journey in the absolute best way possible and I canâ€™t say anymore because I will start crying for the fifth time.
â€œyou must enter where you fear to treadâ€
She said one of the hardest things for her was to sit back and not say a word when people were bashing how she was treating Chaol. Letting people believe that his story didnâ€™t matter to her; when she was yearning to write his story; not solely for the reason that his journey tilts the table of the war for Aelin and Company; but because she adores his character and has always had great plans for him.
â€œHere; with her; he was home.â€
I have read some of my friendâ€™s reviews who do deal with more crucial disabilities that I myself deal with; and I am happy to see that they feel represented; loved; appreciated; and like they too could kick the bad guyâ€™s back-end.
Also: I like that she doesnâ€™t shy away from the fact that Chaol is a complete and total jerk when it comes to women in this book either. But do not fright my dears; he sees the errors of his ways one way or another and comes to his senses.
There is also more representation for People of Color and the LGBT community as well!
I have read some comments from people asking if you can read this book without reading the rest of the series. Let me be perfect clear: absolutely not. This is how I believe you should read it.
01. Throne of Glass
02. Crown of Midnight
03. Heir of Fire
04. Queen of Shadows
05. The Assassinâ€™s Blade (all five novellas)
06. Empire of Storms
07. Tower of Dawn
Again; Sarah voiced that her novellas are crucial to the story line (and that has been proven to be correct). She doesnâ€™t write them to get more money or to advertise for her books or anything greedy like that; some stories are shorter than others; but they are still important.
For example; you have to read The Assassin and the Pirate Lord before you read Empire of Storms; and you have to read The Assassin and the Healer before you read Tower of Dawn. You miss crucial parts of the story when you donâ€™t read a Maas novella.
The Healer is named Yrenne and she is one of three (err; four if you count the last two-so pages.. #heartbroken) point of views in this book; Nesryn and Chaol being the other two. I loved there only being three points of views for a change.
Maas has a reputation now for putting a lot of steam in her book; and I want to tell you that this one is very tame. There is one scene. Thatâ€™s it. So if you didnâ€™t like all the scenes in Empire of Storms or in her other series A Court of Thrones and Roses; this book may be right up your alley.
I donâ€™t want to give too much away in this book; but a lot of it is about healing and forgiving yourself. We went on a journey with Aelin and now we get to see a journey not only with Chaol but also with Yrene. These characters have all been through horrible stuff; but they overcome it and are stronger because of it.
I have been going through a lot of hardships lately and reading this book has shown me that I will be alive tomorrow; I will be able to not get over it but get passed it; and I will and can be happy if I only let myself.
PS: Sorry for the novel.. but not really sorry.

I'm really liking this so far because there's only a few POVs and not twenty.
--
Sarah is as awkward and adorable as I wanted her to be. She loves her characters as much as we do and cries as much as we do and most importantly she is obsessed with dogs... or animals in general.
---
I get to meet Maas today and I am so pumped for it!

Okay! It took me a while to review this book but I'm finally getting around to doing it. I went into this book with very low expectations. As you may or may not know; SJM's books are a huge rollercoaster for me. I either love or hate them; but I'm glad to say that this book falls into the former category.
Here are my reviews of the rest of SJM books:
Throne of Glass â­â­â­â­
Crown of Midnight â­â­â­â­â­
The Assassin's Blade â­â­â­â­â­
Heir of Fire â­â­â­â­â­
Queen of Shadows â­â­â­â­
Empire of Storms â­â­
A Court of Thorns and Roses â­â­
A Court of Mist and Fury â­â­â­â­â­
A Court of Wings and Ruin â­â­â­â­
I was extremely disappointed by the way Chaolâ€™s character was handled in EoS; so I really wanted this book to redeem him for me; and thatâ€™s exactly what it did.
I found some elements that made me fall in love with this series in the first place and now Iâ€™m definitely reading the last book when it comes out.
The only reason I didnâ€™t give this book 5 stars is because there was a lot of fluff. All the unnecessary scenes made the book terribly slow; which is why it took me fifty million years to finish it. I feel like it should have been at least 200 pages shorter. You can definitely tell the idea for this book started out as a novella but then got stretched a bit too much in my opinion.
Here are the main things I loved about this book:
*Finally some diversity.
*Disability representation was on point.
*Throwback to The Assassinâ€™s Blade (one of my favorites in this series)
*Ships sinking.
*Ships sailing.
*RUKS!
*Lack of Aelin.
*Lack of velvet-wrapped steel action.
Overall; this was an enjoyable read and I canâ€™t wait to find out how the series wraps up in the final book!
Thanks for reading; please share your thoughts.

I got as far as page 30. Less than 5%. I can't anymore
When you're stealing from another author yet you're still praised for originality; I call bullshit. Such a lack of creativity or originality--she literally calls Chaol ""the Hand of the King."" As Kiki pointed out in her review; this isn't a historical title used ever; it has only ever been used in Game of Thrones; and I guess SJM just decided it sounds cool and pulled it. Awesome. She literally stole another author's invention. ’ There's this among other Game of Throne pulls; and it's absolutely laughable SJM is trying to make this into GoT.
Whether Aelin-Asahjsbdkwna-Galakabsjans-her-name-sounds-like-a-fucking-STD is in it or not; she is mentioned CONSTANTLY--praised of course. Because she has no faults at all; by far the worst character development I've ever seen (because there IS NOT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT; I read the first four books and she never once acts like an assassin. She's an assassin only in name); and by far the greatest Mary Sue.
STD aside; I think it's really SJM's writing I can't get into. It's direct and simple yes; but it honestly sucks. It's so damn predictable and everyone is fucking beautiful and perfect and a king and Queen and princess and perfect perfect perfect perfect....the writing drags (she's great at writing filler books); its over the top with drama and melodrama; it's so damn REPETITIVE; the characters are all just recycled versions of one another; their words are recycled versions of one another (all the perspectives sound the same) and it's just so stupid. My tolerance level for SJM's stupidity has reached -10000+.
I actually made a DNF shelf because of this book. I BASICALLY NEVER DNF books but SJM is my downfall.
Then there's apparently this whole cultural appropriation thing. See this review here for more information and make up your own mind:
https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...
I don't want to say she did that but just using a culture and names and whatnot in your book and then changing a few letters doesn't make it your own. You can't just change Khan to Khagan or whatever and claim it's something new--and yes she is claiming it's something new because it's in her story and she's playing it off as her own invention. Even if you cite it at the end; that's just like admitting where you stole something from. She's made something new by stealing from something else.
Again--lack of creativity. And it's just fucking lazy.
I really don't care if she puts POC in this or not. In the short amount I read there seems to be a lot but it seems she's only trying to appease her critics; to which I say ""it's too late sweetie they've already branded you an anti-diversity piece of shit"". I mean on one hand I can see why people want to be represented but ultimately Iâ€™m with the authorâ€” she can write whatever she wants; but letâ€™s also be honest:she sucks at diversity; she lives to either kill POC off or make them lovely background characters or have background token gay characters. I find it hilarious actually that when she includes this she must be thinking â€œSEE LOOK IM BEING INCLUSIVE!â€ Like lady. Youâ€™re not doing it well; just stay away from it. But the whole diversity thing isnâ€™t my main at all with this series. THE WRITING IS JUST ATROCIOUS. THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IS ATROCIOUS. THE PLOT IS PREDICTABLE AND I CANT TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. ITS. JUST. SO....BAD.
And finally the fans. The same ones who say ""you need to read the rest for the series; it gets so much better!!!"" And then when I hate it they say ""well why'd you read it?"" BECAUSE YOU SAID IT GETS BETTER. I don't think I've ever given an author as many chances as I've given SJM. But no the series did not get better; IT GOT WORSE. I read books 1--4 SJM stans. I will never understand the appeal--she just can't write well; it's all the same.
***Also to the fans; if you like this series; good for you. Honestly. I'm not trying to start a war with you guys in the comments but I have the right to complain about a series I hate in MY review. And that's what I did. Go gloat about SJM in the MANY glowing reviews for this book. I donâ€™t care if you love her foreverâ€”Iâ€™ve got friends on here that love her books and good for themâ€”I really wanted to like this series but...itâ€™s not for me..***
The worst part is I still like Chaol (and of course that's the one SJM cares least about and fans don't really like; because he's not just a walking pair of hot abs). He isn't a bad character at all; he's the most realistic and decent (right next to Dorian) but SJM as destroyed him for the sake of a ship; and no matter how much I like him; I can't go through this again. And then there's the ending. I'm not putting it in a spoiler tag because we all knew it would happen--Chaol is healed and walks just fine. Of course she wouldn't have a well rounded disabled character. Shame; I think that would have been really interesting but alas; they must all be perfect right? That's the SJM way. No substance or nuance; Mary Sues all round.
Is it me? Have I outgrown YA? Am I too critical? Or is it that YA has always sucked (majority) and I just noticed??
I think it's the last option. We praise mediocrity and idiots in this society. We know the names of people who are famous off a sex tape more than a noble prize winner; we know the name of an idiotic writer of a Mary Sue Extravaganza more than we know the names of truly incredible writers.
Fucking hell.
My reviews for this bullshit series I am officially done with:
The Stupid Beginning: Throne of Glass Review: â­ï¸â­ï¸
The Predictable Continuation: Crown of Midnight Review:â­ï¸
THE BIGGEST FUCKING BULLSHIT FILLER BOOK; MY GOD THE WRITING WAS AT ITS APEX OF TERRIBLENESS: Heir of Fire Review â­ï¸
The Mary Sue Apex. Strong female character? Development? Are those words in SJMs vocabulary??? Queen of Shadows Review â­ï¸
And now take a look at my notes where I tried to endure this. I really fucking tried.
Thank God I didn't spend money on this.
EDIT 8.14.17
Wow I've changed a lot in two months...I don't even know if I'll make it to this book now--I don't know if I can make it past book 4...book 4 will be make it or break it for me with this series. Still love Chaol and Dorian; but everyone else can go to hell.
Who knows if I'll make it this far.
This is all Celaena's fault--and SJM's terrible writing.

And the even better news is that I only read book 1; and I still have 4 other books to read in the series + the novella; until I get to this; and this comes out in September; so I can keep pushing reading those books till I'm closer to September to 1) remember the story better and 2) not wait in agony like some readers ˆ

-Sartaq & Nesryn
Ladies and Gentlemen; the quote that had my heart breaking in two.
This book was kickaztec and full of surprises.. one of them being the 5stars it so deserves.
As suspected Chaol still had eye-roll moments but SJM finally made him clean up his act and be bearable.. if it wasnâ€™t for Yrene heâ€™d have been a lost cause; nothing worth reading about. Yrene Towers was Chaolâ€™s better half for sure; he needed someone as awesome as her to get him out of his self loathing and let go of his bitter misplaced hatred for Aelin.
The Khaganâ€™s children were all interesting characters; some good; others not so much but both added to the awesomeness of this book. Princess Hasar; in my opinion; had a personality mix between Manon and Aelin; I didnâ€™t know whether to love her or pull a Yrene move; lol.
The revelations in this story left me mind blown and absolutely speechless. I wasnâ€™t expecting a 1/4 of what happened; honestly... except maybe about the part about Maeve..
Now lastly we get to my favorite characters in this book; Nesryn and Sartaq™Œ»–¤
I was rooting for them since they first met.. fearless; adventurous and amazing; theyâ€™re perfect.
So yea; this was a solid 5 Star read for me.

Narrated in lyrical prose and third-person past tense; Arden weaves a tale no less compelling for its slow; gradual development. Like all the best fairy tales; the author draws on the setting - a village in the northern woods of Rus' - to create an atmosphere that promises magic and suggests many horrors.
Atmosphere is the key word here: The Bear and the Nightingale captures that feeling of uncertainty and superstition. The characters are somewhere between the old and the new; believing in modern religion but still deeply tied to the stories of old - the creatures that hide in the dark; the demons lurking in corners; the spirits living in the woods.
The protagonist is Vasya; a feisty; stubborn girl who always manages to find her way into adventure and; often; trouble. Quick-witted and rebellious; it's hard not to fall in love with her instantly. There's a sense throughout that she is at one with nature; belonging to the very setting of the novel - the wild; rugged landscape of her youth. She is most at home when running and playing in the woods.
When her father remarries and brings Vasya's intense and devout new stepmother back to their village; the safety of everyone is threatened. Her stepmother refuses to appease the creatures of the forest and darkness creeps ever closer. The arrival of a young priest who challenges the people's belief in the old spirits endangers them further. It is Vasya - and her own strange gifts - who is the family's only chance against the evil spirits at work.
A haunting story; one so deeply atmospheric that you can almost feel the cold air on your skin as you're reading.

Tell us of the frost-demon; the winter-king Karachun.â€
This book is magical. This book is whimsical. This book is one of the best things Iâ€™ve read in my entire life. I loved this with every bone; every red blood cell; every molecule in my body. This book was nothing short of perfection; and Iâ€™m sorry to gush; but I never expected this story to captivate me the way it did.
â€œIn Russian; Frost was called Morozko; the demon of winter. But long ago; the people called him Karachun; the death-god. Under that name; he was king of black midwinter who came for bad children and froze them in the night.â€
Iâ€™m not even sure where to begin with this story; but I guess I will start by saying that this story is a love letter to stories everywhere. This book is a mash-up retelling of many Russian fairy tales; but with unique spins of them; which are woven together to tell such a beautiful tale that makes me breathless just thinking about how expertly it is crafted.
Vasilisa and her family live on the edge of the Russian wilderness. Vasilisaâ€™s father rules these lands; and her mother died giving birth to her; knowing that she was special. Vasilisa was raised by her motherâ€™s nursemaid; who is constantly telling her fairy tales that most Russians fear; but Vasilisa loves.
â€œYou must remember the old stories. Make a stake of rowan-wood. Vasya; be wary. Be brave.â€
Vasilisa soon realizes that she is indeed special; and that she can see creatures that most people cannot. And; again; instead of feeling fear; she feels compassion and befriends and takes care of all the different creatures that dwell on her lands.
And even though Vasilisaâ€™s family accepts her; the rest of the community cannot see past how different she is. Vasilisaâ€™s father tries many different things to get her to want the same things most girls in this time want (marriage; babies; performing â€œwomanlyâ€ duties); while Vasilisa only wants to be free and see the world.
Meanwhile; there is a frost-demon that does everything to ensure him and Vasilisaâ€™s paths cross. And Vasilisa couldnâ€™t resist the urge to go to him even if she tried. Then a beautiful story unfolds about a girl; a nightingale; and a bear; who are destined to have a story told.
â€œBefore the end; you will pluck snowdrops at midwinter; die by your own choosing; and weep for a nightingale.â€
Like Iï¸ said; itâ€™s now an all time favorite for me! Iï¸ truly loved this story that much. It deserves all the praise; all the hype; and all the love.
This book had absolutely everything that I love in my fantasy:
âœ Feminist as all hell
âœ Magical forest
âœ All the morally grey characters
âœ Mythology and folklore
âœ Little fae folk saving the day
âœ Wintery setting
And when I say that this is the perfect winter read; I mean it with everything that I am. Never have I ever read a better seasonal read. Please give this a try in the upcoming months. I promise you; you wonâ€™t regret it
This book was nothing short of magical. From the lyrical prose; to the atmospheric town and forest; to the characters that constantly had me crying; to the message that girls can be anything they want to be; no matter what society tries to confine them to. This book is a tangible piece of heaven and I am so thankful that I was able to read this before the end of 2017; because it truly is a shining star in 2017 publications. I cannot wait to start my ARC of The Girl in the Tower tonight!
â€œI am only a story; Vasya.â€
And this book is extra special to me; because this is the book that all the wonderful people at The Goodreads Power User Summit gave to me! Which makes it all the sweeter that it ended up being one of my favorite books of all time.

Thereâ€™s just something extremely entrancing about this breed of fantasy that delves deep into the origins of storytelling and employs the stone foundation of fairytales to tell a story that is at once comforting and familiar as well as subversive; vibrant and new.
This book shares the same DNA as Naomi Novikâ€™s marvelously brilliant Uprooted; and Spinning Silver: the three tales all center on young women who are stronger than they know and their monster-later-turned-ally who arenâ€™t as monstrous as everyone think they are. Itâ€™s a premise that appeals to me so much; which is why this book worked so well for me!
So; what's this book about?
The people of a village in northern Russia have lived with the certainty that demons move through their world like they move through their words; disasters beyond its boundaries; and Vasilisa Petrovnaâ€”youngest child of a wealthy boyar and heir to ancient magicâ€”has lived with the burden of it. Vasilisa can see spirits; the creatures of hearth; lake; stable and woods who protect her town and its people; and she kept this truth like a bird that she was worried of frightening awayâ€”until her father brings home a new bride who fears the wood spirits she can also see and forbids Vasya any communion with them.
Not long after; a young; arrogant priest is sent to her village; ready to prod and stoke the rumors about demons; using it as his most powerful weapon because it is the villagersâ€™ most potent fear; until they turn away from their old ways. When the people fail to pay the tithe that kept the spirits from fading; the crops wither away and the wolves creep close to the village and when Vasyaâ€™s many attempts to keep the old magical protections in place fall through; the townspeople all sought to repair the fault in the world by demanding to put her out of it.
But the worst nightmare they could hope to conjure for Vasya would pale beside the one that already lived in the woodsâ€”blasted; hungry and more terrible than the Winter King himselfâ€”and that wanted Vasya and all she holds dear.
The Bear and the Nightingale is a very atmospheric; sprawling yet so deftly-crafted fairy tale that ticks all my reading boxes: witchcraft; magic; and history. Itâ€™s a gorgeous novel; grounded in Russian folklore but richly overlaid with an immersive; creative story of its own; and rendered in languorous and sensuous prose. The characters are ice and fire; they bite and fight and delight all at once. The plot moves with a slow grace; gradually building a world encroached by darkness and creeping inch by dreadful inch towards a freshly hideous futureâ€”unless the stalwart heroine; whose fate seems sealed to a provincial life but is suddenly uprooted; saves it.
The author pours just enough nuance into each character to make them feel real in the moment; breaking them out of the trope mold and shaping them into something entirely unique. And itâ€™s that delicate touch that keeps the novel from becoming relentlessly bleak. Vasya holds the spirit of a girl backed up to the worldâ€™s edge; ready to spread her arms like wings and fly or fall. Sheâ€™s always refused to go along; to make herself small enough to slip past a looming danger; to stay quiet and unobtrusive; she no sooner thought a thing than said it; or wanted a thing than she tried to get it. Her fierce determination kindles. Itâ€™s always there; always smoldering; and it doesnâ€™t take much to set it alight. I love how insatiable she was in her thirst for the extraordinary; how she didnâ€™t settle for the mediocre and how her journey was about growing and becoming a more magnified; specific version of herself. The Winter King was an interesting character as wellâ€”he and Vasya are so tangled in my mind; all blood and vengeance and strife; and I rooted for them.
â€œAll my life;â€ she said; â€œI have been told â€goâ€™ and â€come.â€™ I am told how I will live; and I am told how I must die. I must be a manâ€™s servant and a mare for his pleasure; or I must hide myself behind walls and surrender my flesh to a cold; silent god. I would walk into the jaws of hell itself; if it were a path of my own choosing. I would rather die tomorrow in the forest than live a hundred years of the life appointed me.â€
Moreover; I liked how this book captures the richness of relationships among family and friends; explores human and alien social structures; fathers and daughters; damaged relationships and hidden agendas and wrings out many lessons from unexpected consequences. Itâ€™s also refreshing to find a book where characters donâ€™t fall in immediate; all-consuming; passionately forbidden love; each character by itself was a brittle; sharp-edged fragment; and they didnâ€™t seek to palliate or soften their jagged edges to make a wholeâ€”and I like it that way.
Overall; The Bear and The Nightingale is a gorgeous medieval fable that blossoms into a thoughtful; emotionally complex tale. Every night; I would tell myself Iâ€™d just read a few chapters; and every night Iâ€™d blow past that because I simply couldnâ€™t put it down. Highly recommended!

Words cannot describe how much I cherish this book. The characters were described so well and the story was absolutely fantastic and so magical. â™¡â™¡â™¡
Certain parts of the story felt so nostalgic to me. It reminded me of my upbringing with my Russian grandmother and our old Orthodox Church. Matyushka; Batyushka and many of the other words in the story evoked a glimpse into my past. There wasnâ€™t anything I didnâ€™t love about this book. Happy with all of it; every word; even the ending.
I would definitely recommend reading the glossary in the back of the book first to understand the meaning of some of the words. â™¡â™¡â™¡
I have high expectations and canâ€™t wait for the second book â€œThe Girl in the Tower.â€

So this was... unexpectedly amazing. Somehow; I went into this thinking it was a slow-paced; long-developing high fantasy novel; which is just completely untrue. The Bear and the Nightingale; instead; is a compulsively bingeable; gorgeously written; and ridiculously compelling dark fairytale.
Thinking back on this book; there are three things that stand out to me.
âž½ a e s t h e t i c
Okay; first of all; this book has completely stunning writing. I canâ€™t believe this is a debut; because the words just feel like they fly off the pages. But also; this is one of the most aestheticy books I have ever read and I love it. Itâ€™s just all so intriguing and so atmospheric Wintrey setting. Magical forest. Fairy tale elements. Folklore gone right. Folklore gone wrong. Demons and dark creatures. Creatures somewhere in between.
âž½ c h a r a c t e r s
Thereâ€™s an excellent cast of side characters; Iâ€™m a huge fan of Vasilisaâ€™s sister and brother. Even the villains of the book; especially her stepmother; gained my sympathy; she is a fantastically compelling villain; so well-written that she becomes all the more sympathetic. But my favorite part of this whole book was Vasilisa and her character arc. She starts out a more naive character; young and treated well by her father; yet driven by her desire to be free and one with nature. But as the mistreatment by her stepmother grows; she becomes more and more determined to be free; which I found made for a very compelling character arc. Thus; even when sheâ€™s not driving the plot; she feels like a major force in the book.
âž½ t h e m e s
The Bear and the Nightingale is a dark fairytale; and like any good dark fairytale; it has a lot of meaning beneath the surface. This book deals primarily with religious oppression; and the way religion can be used for destruction. But it also deals with the specificity of the destruction of nature. Vasilisa's world is crumbling around her; and it's so difficult to witness. She loves this world so deeply. And just like our natural world; it is beginning to crumble.
I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll feel about book two; but Iâ€™m super excited based off where this ended. Thereâ€™s a nice setup for some moral greyness; maybe; and I really like that the love interest is a death frost demon. No; really. Beautiful and terrifying; and with the vibe of every dark fairytale ; I cannot recommend this enough.

You will have to wait until 201 to get your hands on it.
First; a metaphor. Have you ever been about to eat something; thinking it's flavored with vanilla and cinnamon? Then you bite into it and discover ginger and nutmeg (also favorites of mine.)
This book is a bit like that. It's fantasy. Okay; I've read lots of that. It's told rather like a fairy tale. Okay; ready for that.
It's told a bit like a Russian fairy tale only the setting is very grounded in a reality that will leave your nose and toes chilled and make you wish a horse like that would come your way.

this is a stunning debut that perfectly mimics the tone of a classic fairytale; but breathes new and exciting life into the familiar themes with lyrical writing; strong characters; and by weaving in elements of russian folklore; which were mostly unfamiliar to me; and therefore fresh and exotic.
quickplot first; then i will return to these three strengths in greater detail.
pyotr vladimirovich is a lord in medieval rus'; responsible for the well-being of several villages in the heavily-forested wilderness; subject to his late wife marina's half-brother; the grand prince in moscow. he has five children; the youngest of which is a daughter named vasilisa/vasya; whose birth caused marina's death. it was a risky; late pregnancy; but marina was determined to have her; knowing that vasya would be her only child gifted with the magical birthright held by her bloodline's women. vasya grows up with a curious mind and a wandering nature - dressing like a boy; drawn to exploring the forest; and befriending the house spirits the villagers all leave ritual offerings for; in a long-standing superstitious tradition; but which only she is able to see. it's a hard life; with food shortages during the long cold winters; and vasya's latent power attracts the attention of morozko; an old spirit personifying the relentless cold known by many different appellations: demon of winter; death-god; frost demon; winter-king. when pyotr is in moscow arranging his daughter olga's marriage; and unexpectedly finding himself married off to an equally-reluctant bride as a political favor; morozko is insulted by one of pyotr's sons; whom he allows to live in exchange for the promise of vasya's hand in marriage. this arrangement dismays vasya's nurse dunya; who tries to put it off as long as possible; and it is more or less forgotten as time passes and more pressing concerns arise; specifically the influence of an ambitious priest; adored by vasya's stepmother; who forbids the villagers to continue their practice of acknowledging the household spirits; which results in horrors only vasya has the power to prevent.
arden's writing is the book's strongest selling point: evocative; beautifully descriptive; imagery that pops with details alive enough to make you smell the smoke and feel the cold; it's haunting; vivid; and poetic. when pyotr and his sons leave their village in order to meet with their royal relative in moscow; they encounter a city of smiling enemies and barbed favors described as lusty and squalid; like a fair woman with feet caked in filth.
occasionally; it can get a little too adjective-crazed:
Great trees threw sooty shadows onto the raw wood of the little church.
but for the most part; it is well-controlled .
character is also an easy sell - vasilisa; like all of the best fairytale heroines; is the inheritor of a great responsibility; the fulfillment of a prophecy that is equal parts burden and gift. her wildness is part of her appeal; power and freedom and all the beauty and mystery of nature: She looked like a wild thing new-caught and just barely groomed into submission. she doesn't know the extent of her powers; or even that she has powers; but they can be felt by others; like her father; who understands that the ordinary roles available to women; wife and mother; would ruin something essential to her character.
""She is a handsome girl;"" said Pyotr. ""Though a savage. She needs a husband; it would steady her."" But as he spoke; an image came to him of his wild girl wedded and bedded; sweating over an oven. The image filled him with a strange regret; and he shook it away.
even the priest konstantin is drawn to her; despite his severity towards her; and laments the future he is nonetheless pushing her towards:
He saw all at once; as Pyotr had seen; the wild thing brought indoors; busy and breathless; a woman like other women. Like Pyotr; he felt a strange sorrow and shook it away. ..he thought again of years; of childbearing and exhaustion. The wildness gone; the hawk's grace chained upâ€¦He swallowed. It is for the best. The wildness was sinful.
for me; the themes were equally fascinating - i'm always drawn to books focused on transitional periods; clashes between tradition and modernity; the old ways and the new. one of the best of these is Morality Play by barry unsworth; which is about a troupe of actors in the 1300's who dared perform a play that wasn't based upon biblical events and the uneasiness and backlash this causes. while christianity was by no means new to medieval rus'; the confrontation here between religion and tradition is devastating; made more so by the fact that the offerings to the house spirits; followed by the villagers as a tradition with no real belief behind them; turn out to be all that is holding the evil at bay.
a beautiful debut; and i'm very excited to see what else she's got in the works.

I'm at a loss with this one. I can't say that I loved it; but I didn't dislike it either. I feel like I'm missing something. This is a story that I should probably go back and re-read at a time when I can give it my full attention...but I didn't feel a strong enough connection the first time around to make me want to do that.
When I listen to an audiobook; I'm usually doing something else that requires part of my attention (i.e. driving). For this reason; I try to keep my audiobook selections pretty straightforward. Unfortunately; this book proved to be too detailed for me to follow in that format. I ended up having to ""rewind"" several times to reorient myself because I'd find myself completely lost.
'The Bear and the Nightingale' ended up being a bit too complicated of a story for me to take in via audiobook. There were details and connections that I'm sure I missed. The fact that I didn't understand some of the Russian words and wasn't able to look them up at the time; certainly contributed to my bewilderment.
In a nutshell; the story dealt with religious persecution as the ""old gods"" and religions were being pushed out by Christianity. The story is set in medieval Russia and the imagery crafted by the author was beautiful. Even when I was admittedly lost; I greatly enjoyed the detailed descriptions provided.
The heroine; Vasya; had special abilities and represented ""good"" in this book. Her mother was determined to have her; even knowing that she would sacrifice her own life. As a result; Vasya grows up to be resented by her father in a way.
When her father decides to remarry; largely in an attempt to tame the spirited Vasya; a political marriage is arranged to Anna. Anna had planned to become a nun and religion is a very large part of her identity. To say the least; she ended up being a nightmare for Vasya.
When the self-righteous Anna teams up with the fear-mongering priest; Konstantin; nobody is safe. Let the witch hunts begin!
Meanwhile; Vasya is given a protective talisman. She is tied to ""Frost""; the winter demon king. Through their abilities and old ""magic"" the two are interconnected. -- I won't lie. I am hazy on the details here.
In many ways; this story was intriguing. At some point; I might give it another try because I'm certain that I missed a great deal. I had a hard time staying focused on this story; not because it was bad; but because I was preoccupied. Nonetheless; it ended up being a ""good but not great"" read for me this time around. It just didn't keep my attention.

Because this is such a magical and atmospheric book. I am glad the sequel just came out; since I could not see myself reading it under different weather conditions.
I knew close to nothing about Russian culture and folklore; so this was my introduction to the latter. Actually; I had heard of Ivan and Baba Yaga â€“ but that is all and I was ashamed of myself; therefore I am happy I was able to learn some things from this book.
Youâ€™d think that after having read more than a thousand books I wouldnâ€™t still be this impressed and in awe when encountering beautifully-lyrical writings styles with vivid imagery in my reads. But I am; and the truth is; itâ€™s not easy to write the way Katherine Arden does. She will fill your mind with wonder and feed your imagination.
This is not a book you will read in one single sitting or even in one single day. Itâ€™s slow-paced and contains very little action as well as a limited amount of settings; but thatâ€™s okay. I did not mind; seeing that I can fall as hard for stories that are character-driven as the other sorts. In fact; I love that we see Vasya grow up into a strong; adventurous and courageous young woman.
I would easily have given it a five-star rating had it not been so heavy on religion; but I understand that religion was and still is important to Russian culture. Furthermore; without the religious theme; this story would have been much shorter and less developed. On the other hand; throughout the story; I wished for Father Konstantin to make his disappearance once and for all; because he was trouble.
Thank you; Katherine Arden; for writing this book. It is a diamond among semi precious stones.

Review first posted on Fantasy Literature:
In the northern lands of medieval Rusâ€™; a daughter is born to Pyotr Vladimirovich; a boyar; lord over many lands; and his wife Marina; who dies in childbirth. But Marina; daughter of the Grand Prince of Moscow and a mysterious; swan-like beggar girl; has bequeathed her daughter Vasilisa a mystical heritage.
Vasilisa the Brave (or Beautiful)
Vasilisa; or Vasya; grows up to be a spirited and rather rebellious young girl who; like an untamed colt; freely roams the fields and forest; and is able to see and communicate with the domovoi (a guardian of the home); rusalka (a dangerous water nymph); and other natural spirits of the home and land. Her beloved nurse Dunya tells Vasya and her siblings stories of Ivan and the Gray Wolf; the Firebird; and the frost-king; Morozko.
But Vasyaâ€™s carefree life ends when her father finally decides to remarry. He brings home a new wife from Moscow; Anna; the daughter of the prince of Moscow; who is also able to see the spirits of the land; but considers them devils and demons; clinging to her cross and her belief in the church. Pyotr also brings home a mysterious gift for Vasya; a necklace with a brilliant silver-blue jewel; given to him by Morozko; whom he met in Moscow. But Pyotr and the old nurse Dunya hold the necklace back from Vasya; fearing to give it to her.
Vasyaâ€™s life with Anna as her stepmother becomes strained: the strictly devout Anna is always at odds with the child of nature; who loves the magical creatures that terrify Anna. Life becomes even more difficult when a new priest arrives from Moscow; Father Konstantin; a handsome and charismatic man who preaches fiery sermons against the spirits of the land. As the people cease honoring (and leaving food for) these spirits; they weaken â€¦ but evil is waiting to step in as their protective influence wanes. Vasya finds herself at odds with her family and the villagers as she strives to protect them against unimaginable dangers that they thought existed only in fairy tales.
The Bear and the Nightingale weaves a richly colored tapestry; combining elements from various Russian fairy tales; a realistic description of life in medieval times; when Russia was not yet a unified country; and an independent an appealing heroine. The frost-king Morozko and his destructive brother; the Bear; play the primary fairy tale roles; but there are additional and sometimes delightfully unexpected Russian folklore elements like the stepmother sending her stepdaughter into the forest to find snowdrops in midwinter (from the story â€œTwelve Monthsâ€); Morozko (also known as Father Frost) sending lost girls home with a dowry of gold and jewels; the Sea-Kingâ€™s daughter; and Vasilisa the Beautiful. (Iâ€™m sure I missed a few more!)
The atmosphere is well-developed; immersing you in life in medieval Rusâ€™; a place where fairy tales may be true â€¦ which is not necessarily a comfortable thing. Enchantments can be good or evil; and the rusalka; vazila (a spirit that guards the stable and livestock) and other nature spirits are dangerous as well as helpful. Arden deftly illustrates their nature; so alien to humankind; as well as the need for mutual understanding and cooperative co-existence; which breaks down so badly in this tale.
A major theme â€• in fact; it propels the entire plot â€• is the conflict between old beliefs; respecting and caring for the nature spirits; and the newer religion; Christianity; which is generally; and emphatically; in the wrong in this book. Father Konstantin and Anna; and the rest of the villagers that flock to follow the priest; are poor examples of religious believers. At times it seems that the novel sets up believers as being generally weak and dangerously misguided; if not evil; though those characters are offset; to some extent at least; by Vasyaâ€™s brother Sasha; who has a sincere heart and desire for a religious vocation; and the monk he follows; Sergei Radonezhsky. In any case; The Bear and the Nightingale certainly effectively illustrates the power of fear; as well as the danger of using that fear; rather than love; to prompt religious devotion.
Another prominent theme is Vasyaâ€™s desire to live life freely; on her own terms; in a time when an arranged marriage or life in a convent were generally the only options for a properly raised female. Though itâ€™s a modern theme; Arden integrates it well into the overall plot; and Vasya doesnâ€™t come off as unduly anachronistic â€¦ though I did get a little tired of seeing her compared to an unbroken filly.
The cruelty of winter and the terrors of the deep; untamed forest; where wolves â€• and worse things â€• rove; are tangible. At the same time; The Bear and the Nightingale also incorporates references to actual historic figures; like Genghis Khan (at this time the Rusâ€™ people were required to pay tributes to the conquering Horde); Sergei Radonezhsky; and princes of Moscow from the fourteenth century; although they are fictionalized.
The Bear and the Nightingale is a well-written and thoroughly thought-out fantasy; suspenseful and delightful. While it reads well as a stand-alone novel; Arden has indicated that two sequels are in process. I canâ€™t wait to be transported to medieval Russia again!
Initial take: This Russia-based fantasy; set in old times when it was not yet a unified country; mingles Russian fairy tales of nature spirits; the Frost King and his destructive brother; the Bear; and a young woman's desire to live life on her own terms when an arranged marriage or life in a convent seem to be the only options for her. When a charismatic young priest comes to their town and rails against the people's beliefs in the nature spirits; Vasya is one of the very few to resist him. And the priest's actions are leading to the weakening of the protective spirits and the strengthening of the Bear.
I wasn't entirely on board with the conflict between old beliefs and nature spirits and Christianity; which was generally in the wrong in this book. But other than that; it's very well-written and well thought out; with Russian fairy tales woven in in some unexpectedly delightful ways.
I received a free copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley. Thank you!

some might say this story was too slow; but i prefer to think of it as being patient. others might complain that there was no plot; but i saw it as being humble. and some could claim the writing was stiff; but i felt the language embodied the frigidity of long russian winters. everything about this felt true to the characterisation of the type of folklore story that this was.
i will definitely be picking this up again come wintertime; cosily bundled up near a fire with a cup of hot chocolate. because this book is the sort of magical warmth and comfort that everyone deserves during the coldest of times.

Russian fairy tales are unlike any others; in my opinion.They are not simple; â€â€™happily-ever-afterâ€™â€™ myths; but wonderfully detailed glimpses in the daily lives of people born in times gone-by and tales that hide themes that are relevant to our era. They contain female heroines that surpass inexplicable odds and many have ambiguous closures. There is a sadness that permeates the Russian fairy tale tradition and a fierceness; a strangely modern idea of feminism. All these features are included in Katherine Ardenâ€™s beautiful first installment of the Winternight Trilogy.
This book has been sitting in my TBR for practically forever; and when the second part came to me as an ARC; I thought it was finally time to begin my journey to Lesnaya Zemlya. In a Russian village; during the late medieval times; a child is born but the mother dies. Vasya has inherited the extraordinary; otherworldly gift of her mother; along with her kind heart; her free spirit of adventure and tolerance. Vasya can see what noone else is worthy to see; but her gift puts her in danger when her father decides to wed another woman. Her name is Anna; a fundamentalist as any has ever seen in any genre in Literature; and another woman who has the ability to see â€â€™demonsâ€™â€™. Terrified of the traces of the pagan culture in her husbandâ€™s territory; she calls for a priest to come and cast away the demons. Konstantin arrives and everything in Vasyaâ€™s life changes.
The essence of the tale is the battle between the pagan tradition and Christianity. Still; â€â€™â€™battleâ€™â€™ isnâ€™t the right word; since this division is completely constructed by a small number of people who wish to serve their own false convictions. Before Anna came to the community; the people had found the perfect balance between the teachings of Christ and the old Russian deities and traditions. Until priests started talking of demons; fire; and eternal damnation. Itâ€™s always been a point of great discourse (and discord) in Literature and in History. In any case; Vasya; Dunya and most of the women are respectful followers of both religions. Anna cannot understand it; locked as she is in her own hallucinations and she descends into a darkness where fear and demons reign. The problem is that she takes everyone else with her.
Arden has composed a tale out of many familiar characteristics of Russian fairy tales. The well-known legend of Lord Winter and the beautiful Maiden lies at the heart of it; while we meet the Baba Yaga; the domovoi (the peaceful spirits that protect the hearth of the Russian household); the vazila; the enchanting Rusalka...The supernatural characters become the heart of the story; because the human characters; well...theyâ€™re not very interesting. Anna would make a fine couple with the Devil she so hates (although Iâ€™d pity the poor manâ€¦); Vasyaâ€™s father is a doormat and Dunya is kind and comforting; but not that original. The one who had my unwavering attention was Konstantin; the young priest. An ambiguous character; fully conflicted; dark and perplexing as he is perplexed. He desperately wants to believe and serve but in what? In whom? His interactions with Vasilisa were brilliant and very intriguing. Besides Vasya and Konstantin; there is another major haunting character; but youâ€™ll have to read it to discover itâ€¦.
So; does the novel worth the hype? In my opinion; yes. Absolutely and definitely. The atmosphere and the transition of the traditional story are exceptionally constructed. Do I think it would be even better if it was written by a Russian writer? Allow me to say that yes; I believe it would. You see; there is a distinctive; haunting veil of sadness; threat and death in the Russian tradition and; while these elements are present in Ardenâ€™s work; they werenâ€™t as tense and concise as Iâ€™d like them to be. At times; the writing became a bit too YA; a genre that I do not appreciate much. This is strictly my personal opinion; formed out of many years of familiarity with Russian Literature and Culture. However; I definitely enjoyed â€â€™The Bear and the Nightingaleâ€™â€™ and I hope that â€â€™The Girl In The Towerâ€™â€™ will be equally satisfying.

Riveting. Entrancing.
This is the sort of book that sweeps you on a journey .
""I want to save you; Vasilisa Petrovna;"" he said. ""I will save you all. There are dark forces that you do not understand.""
To his surprise; and perhaps to her; she laughed.
Vasilisa ""Vasya"" Petrovna lives during the ""old Russia"" - back when fairy and folk tales were not legends.
Vasya always possessed the second sight; which made for some interesting conversations with the various creatures living in and around her home. All the spirits that live in and around her house were quite peculiar;such as the origins of the domovoi:
I am here because the house is here. If the house weren't here; I wouldn't be either
Soon; Vasya's gentle childhood - spent conversing with the domovoi and the vazila (who guards the stables) - is put to an abrupt end.
Her father remarries and while the new woman has the second sight; she interprets the gentle protective spirits as ""demons."" In an effort to ""protect"" the now-teenage Vasya; her father (egged on and persuaded by her step mother) is trying to marry her off.
And; to top it all; a priest moves into their house and is hell-bent (ha) on saving Vasya's soul but all he succeeds in doing is a lot of fear-mongering and weakening of the protective spirits. He quickly becomes obsessed with Vasya and her impertinence.
Without the spirits to protect them; Vasya must face the ever increasing danger of the old gods - alone and armed with nothing by her sheer force of will.
I really enjoyed this one - there's just something so magical about having this novel set in the dead of winter with the old gods circling the dimly lit sleepy cottage.
Vasya lives in a world where being a happy homemaker is the highest achievement of any girl. I appreciated how the author showed Vasya's defiance in small ways (yet ultimately significant ways) - not every girl in YA fiction needs to start an uprising.
A soft voice and a bent head were more fitting when a woman addressed a priest. This girl stared at him brazenly in the face with fey green eyes
Overall; I really enjoyed this one and have already checked out the sequel - I'm so; so curious to see what happens next!
P.s. There is a glossery located in the last few pages. ( hallelujah! ) The author used a few common Russian words and a few loose translations (i.e. the spelling of ""domovoi"" was intended to make it easier for English readers to read). I did struggle a bit to hold all the words in my head...only to discover the glossary at the end. Typical!

Katherine Arden's lush and lovely debut novel deftly transports us to Russia in the 14th century with incredible lyricism- scents-sounds-vivid beauty-subtle intrigue- and gorgeous Russian folklore.
At the start Marina is frail and weak. She has 4 children and is pregnant with her 5th. Pyotr; her husband; and Dunya; her devoted nurse; both beg Marina not to keep the baby. They are fearful she will die. Marina had given Pyotr 3 sons and 1 daughter....but she was still hoping- waiting - determined to give birth to a daughter that carried her mother's magical spirits - a strength that her daughter Olga wasn't born with. Marina said it would be worth leaving her children motherless; to give birth to a daughter with her mothers spirits. If she died she made Pyotr and Dunya to promise to take care of her.
Marina did die. Her daughter; Vasya was born with her grandmothers magical powers; and strengths.
We soon notice Vasya has an insurmountable; unyielding amount of breezy - spunky - independent- energy. She marches the beat of a different drummer ....and she is simply irresistible.
The first time she got lost in the forest - ( she ran off to eat her honeycake); she was scared; cold; and shivering. She was lost in the dusk on the cusp of winter and it was going to snow. She meets a man with one gray eye and the other was missing.
She talks to the man. It's been a long time since he has seen a Russian girl. Vasya didn't understand what he meant- but she said:
""Do you know where we are?""
""I am lost. My father is Pyotr Vladimirovich. If you can take me home; he will see you fed; and give you a place beside the oven. It is going to snow"".
He said he would help her -- but he wanted her to ""come here"" first and help him.
Vasya had no particular reason to be untrusting.
Well.....the man did frighten her. AND THIS IS WHEN I TRUELY FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS HEROINE ...because we watch her courage go in and out. One minute she speaks out strong defending herself - but then the next minute she loses faith and feels vulnerable. It's as if Vasya is AS BIG AS SHE IS SMALL...
and as SMALL AS SHE IS BIG. She is real - whole - so very human!
Her brother; Sasha finds her. She sobs..... They return home. Dunya and and her father are angry. They are worried that they Vasya is a wild child who will run off when she feels like it --and become completely unmanageable. The girl needs a mother Pyotr thinks. I'm thinking... hm? That easy huh? To control a free spirt? I was wondering how many mother's he consulted for such wisdom of his. Haha!
Pyotr may have been angry at Vasya - wanting to punish her. BUT I WAS ANGRY AT HIM!!!
""Pyotr thrashed his daughter the next day; and she wept; so he was not cruel""
Huh??? BEATING IS ALWAYS CRUEL......( no matter what century it is)
""Vasya was forbidden to leave the village; but for once; that was no hardship. She had taken chill; and she had nightmares in which she revisited a one-eye man; a horse; and a stranger in a clearing in the woods"".
My emotions were soooo invested as this story keeps changing and spinning off in surprising directions.
Vasya 'does' wanders back into the woods as a teenager. Around this same time evil is entering the village. Through Pyotr's marriage and a Priest....( both people to be suspicious of); demons are becoming fierce. -- but this is a fairytale ... and Vasya is the GOOD SPIRIT!!!!
This book feels like an instant classic -- An enchanting mystical exotic world!!!!

I added another new bookshelf to Goodreads: religious nutters
I preface my review with that statement; b/c it's important that you know exactly how off-putting I find anyone who uses religion as a crutch to excuse their abominable behavior.
Agamemnon sacrificing his daughter to ensure favorable winds as he sails to Troy? Kill him on his own alter. Spanish Inquisitioners torturing anyone not Catholic for the glory of God? Burn them at the stake. The KKK claiming that a darker skin tone is the mark of Cain to justify their prejudice and hate? String them up in their own front yard. #noimnotkidding
And I have to tell you; if it wasn't for that insufferable jackass Konstantin and the witch-hunting frenzy he worked his congregation into; THE BEAR AND THE NIGHTINGALE would have easily been a 4+ star read.
I loved Vasya and (most of) her family. I was nearly as heartbroken as her father when Sasha left to become a monk. I felt Olga's frustration and amusement at her younger sister who refused to be tamed. And when that creep Karil made eyes at Vasya; I clenched my fists and ground my teeth along with Alyosha.
More than the characters; I loved the folklore. The house spirits; the nature fae; the pagan gods . . . Vasya's world was steeped in fantastical creatures. The vodianoy who stole Kolya's basket of freshly caught fish; the rusalka who agreed to stop drowning men from the village in exchange for friendship and fresh blossoms; and the vazila who taught Vasya to speak to horses are a mere fraction of what Arden's Rus' has to offer.
And if the villains in this tale had been limited to an evil stepmother and a dark god; it would've been my perfect read.
BUT. Religion. Christianity; to be specific; hellbent on choking the life out of everything not equally Christian; and how is this best accomplished? Fear and intimidation; naturally. Also blame. It's important to have an unconventional woman at hand; the better to accuse of witchcraft when the opportunity inevitably presents itself. *flares nostrils*
I'm not trying to discredit this tactic as a viable plot device; I'm just explaining my hatred of it. It's 100% a personal preference; which is why I have zero qualms about recommending THE BEAR AND THE NIGHTINGALE to anyone who interested in reading this type of folklore-influenced fantasy. YES; even those rare individuals who hate religious nutters as much as I do--apparently; this is the first book in a trilogy; and as I'm relatively confident that said issue is resolved; which means the next book has even greater potential for awesome.
Looking forward to it.

I have to say that I've not read anything quite like this one; but believe me; that IS meant as a compliment.
It transports the reader back to medieval Russia; to a place thick with forests and deep crisp glistening snow. It is here that we find Vasya; and her family. Vasya is a child of nature; a wild and wilful girl. She has powers that leave the villagers questioning the nature of those powers; many believing that she's a witch. It's difficult to go into too much detail without spoiling it for other readers; but this is a most unusual tale that reads like a fairytale but was written with a more adult audience in mind.
The imagery is simply wonderful; the characters leap out of the page; and the storyline is a mixture of history and Russian folklore. What an ambitious debut novel this is; but Katherine Arden has pulled it off beautifully.

This was a book like that for me. I absolutely adored it - and I am not quite sure if this review will at all be coherent; but I'll try my best.
This was a book that I was super super excited to get to read early. I love books set in Russia; especially the North of Russia; I love Fairy Tales; I love the books the blurb compared it to. I only wanted to read the first chapter because I have loads of unfinished books already but I was immediately drawn in and did not feel like reading anything else. I absolutely devoured it and when I came up again I was a bit sad that the book wasn't longer (especially because the last 3% were the glossary so the book ended a good 15 pages before I thought it would!). That so rarely happens with me!
The book tells the story of Vasya; a child whose mother was a bit other-worldly and who died giving birth to her. Vasya is different herself; being able to converse with household-spirits that nobody else can see. In true fairy tale fashion; her father remarries and the stepmother is; well not exactly evil; but one of the main antagonistic forces of this story. In a world where the new Christian beliefs are at odds with the older; heathen beliefs; this conflict comes to a head when a new priest is appointed to their little village and sets into motion a series of events that will have the heroine come face to face with arcane powers.
Set in the North of Russia with its seemingly ever-lasting winter; the author creates an atmosphere so believable; and enchanting; and surreal; and creepy; and beautiful; I could picture it every step of the way. Her characters are equally believable and even though they all fit the tropes of the genre; Katherine Arden adds little twists that make this story incredibly original and readable. One of my favourite of her decisions was the complete lack of romantic interest the heroine shows. She just wants to decide her life for herself; a difficult thing to do in a time when the two options open for her are a) marriage or b) joining a convent.
Overall; in case anyone missed it; I absolutely adored this book and its main character. I love the little nods to fairy tales I grew up with and I love the focus on making your own choices rather than just doing what is expected and/ or easy. The only slight negative I can find is that I found the ending to be rushed; but then again I just didn't want the book to end; ever.

â€œI gave everything for you; Vasilisa Petrovna.â€
â€œNot everything;â€ said Vasya. â€œSince clearly your pride is intact; as well as your illusions.â€
Borrowing heavily from Russia for its winter setting and mythology; this debut focuses on Vasya; and her ability to see the spirits surrounding her small town. While both have always lived together peacefully; a new religious movement disbands practices honoring such spirits; upsetting the balance. This was a buddy read with these two awesome peeps; Rachelle and Mary! (And Iâ€™m 146 years late with this review)
This was gorgeously atmospheric slow-burn. The plot was in no hurry as we spend time with Vasya and her family. Itâ€™s slow; but it works. Each family member had a unique presence I felt every time they entered the scene; and the harsh; frigid setting was so vivid I was reaching for extra blankets.
As pronounced as all the characterâ€™s are; Iâ€™m especially attached to our protagonist. I love characterâ€™s who are powerful without using their fists. Vasyaâ€™s gift makes her a social outcast among her town (and sometimes own family) especially when sheâ€™s the only one that sees upcoming danger. While not an overt rebel like Katniss or Caelena; she still does all she can to enact change and protect those she loves. Sheâ€™s a little reckless and flawed; but overall incredibly charming and lovable. Seeing a young woman bask in her own agency is always a delight. (Especially in a historical!)
(Have I mentioned yet thereâ€™s no romance???)
I am somewhat confused by the ending; however. Namely the rushed conclusion and loose ends I understand this is part of series; but there were so many things Arden spent ample time detailing and setting up that ended up meaning very little. (And the nightingale from the actual title is mentioned maybe once) The mythology that builds the entire book reaches a crescendo in the last chapterâ€¦ but I wanted more??? I got one chapter after all that build up and wanted more monsters. (Thereâ€™s literally a character who is essentially Death and heâ€™s present for two chapters?)
Also; despite Vasya herself being strong without violence; there's an absurd amount of people hitting each other? I swear every other chapter someone 'struck' someone who was screaming or 'slapped' someone they disagreed with. I wasn't particularly fond of it the first time; and it was annoyingly repetitive.
While a lot of the plot sounds very YA; there are some incredibly mature themes throughout the story. Two of my favorites were Vasyaâ€™s interactions with her family; and how to respect someone even when disagreeing (which some of the characters here need to learn cause BOI!) Another involves the need for balance between religion and culture. Neither the priest or the townsfolk swearing off the spirits are presented negatively for being religious. Instead; bad stuff starts happening when they start but imposing regulations on others because of said religion.
Overall:
Every bit a fairy-tale; with interesting â€monsters;â€™ a fun heroine and a strong focus on family. Hopefully the next installment picks up some of the pieces left behind. (less)",232,NEXTBOOK

I was ready to write this off pretty early. The first 25% or so gave me nightmare flashbacks to reading Uprooted (don't judge) and I was about to toss this on my ""not for me"" shelf and be done with it. Gladly the remaining 75% did a great job of changing my mind.
While I tend not to be a fan of the impersonal; sparse (although often lovely) narration used to tell fairy tales and mythology; I found that Arden used it to great effect here. Vasya; in critical danger of reaching special snowflake status (cough Agnieszka); ended up actually being a really cool protagonist and Morozko; in critical danger of falling into awful; douchey Dragon territory; ended up being a legitimately interesting anti-hero/(view spoiler)
The fairy tale influence was really interesting and informative. It's always cool to learn the folklore native to different parts of the world. I especially love the idea of different spirits inhabiting different buildings and creatures and nature. I initially got a decidedly anti-religion vibe with the disparity between the Old Beliefs and Christianity. One significant character in particular embodies the (historically accurate) evil of using fear and death to force Christianity upon the people at the expense of their cherished beliefs instead of allowing them to co-exist as they had been (not cool; bro). Honestly; I find the religious nut plot device frustrating and contrived but whatever. However; I feel like it wasn't so much the author making a critique on religion in general as it was demonstrating the peril of using fear and constraint to prompt faith (Crusades anyone?). We're led to believe that Vasya's beloved brother; Sasha; although not heavily featured; provides the foil of a peaceful; respectful and sincere seeker of faith through religion.
Even before I began I wasn't expecting to enjoy this- some books you have to read just because everyone else is- but I'll count it as a wonderfully pleasant surprise.

In northern Rusâ€™ the family of Pyotr Vladimirovich are waiting out the last days and nights of winter; with rapidly dwindling food supplies gathered before the winter snows began. Marina; his wife; tells him that she is with child.
Pyotr is not happy; fearful for her life. She is already physically weak. Marina had wanted another daughter; although theyâ€™d already have three sons and a daughter. Sheâ€™s determined to carry this child to term; sure that this girl child will carry her motherâ€™s gifts of taming animals; seeing the future and harnessing natureâ€™s powers.
This story centers on a young woman named Vasya who takes her first breaths of life even as her mother takes her last.
Vasya was not an easy infant to care for; but Dunya; who was Marinaâ€™s nurse as an infant; now raises Vasya through her infancy; childhood. As a young woman; Vasya is free to do what she wishes most of her days. She develops a bond with the horses; speaking to them; whispering sweetness until they trust her enough to come to her willingly. As sweet as Vasya can be; she is a force of nature; filled with determination; strong-willed and independent; while also filled with a strong family bond. She loves her family; and will do what is necessary to protect them.
An enchanting tale set in an extraordinarily lovely; atmospheric setting; a blend of fairy-tale; folklore; myths; and history with a strong young heroine leading the way. Whatâ€™s not to love?

""Am I a child? Always someone else must decide for me. But this I will decide for myself.""
The Bear and the Nightingale is a wonderfully atmospheric story with a definite origin in the Slavic folktales. From the very beginning; we can feel how the story takes root in the classic fairy tale formula.
Independent protagonist? Check. Concerned Father/siblings? Check. Evil stepmother? Check. Affinity for nature? Check. Magical forest? Check.
However; none of these character designs came across as overused or cliche. Instead; it created that warm sense of nostalgia that we all feel whenever we hear our favorite childhood stories. I felt as though I already had a level of intimacy with the characters before meeting them because I have met them before in their previous incarnations.
They are comfortable & familiar; but they are individual enough to stand on their own.
A similar familiarity exists within the plot structure. Prophecies & bewtiched artifacts & the promise of destruction without the intervention of the protagonist. This in combination with the Russian influence really made for a charming read.
I've seen many comparisons between this novel & Uprooted by Naomi Novik; but honestly this is the story I wanted Uprooted to be. Yes there are similarities; but where Uprooted was convoluted & full of weak characters & confusing motives; The Bear and the Nightingale is a written with clarity of purpose & its characters are enchanting & dimensional.
Arden's writing style is full of luxurious detail. From the chilly glow of a snow covered forest to the aroma of baking sweet cakes; the author's attention to detail & effortless way with words is reminiscent of Laini Taylor.
Where this book fell short for me is in its reread value; I don't see myself ever wanting to reread this in the future. That isn't always a bad thing; as there are many wonderful books I'm sure I'll never reread. However; I had the distinct thought ""I can't see myself wanting to experience this story a second time;"" despite the positive feelings of nostalgia it brought me.
It's a great story with a lot to appreciate; especially for fans of Fantasy & Folklore. Those who enjoyed the atmosphere of Novik's Uprooted but wanted more from the story; or fancied the setting of Leigh Bardugo's Grisha trilogy I think will find a this read on their favorites list.

Exquisitely written; brilliant and evocative imagery; fully fleshed characters and a fantastic rendering of the history of this time period; seamlessly woven with the myths and folklore of Russian lore. The first half; the cold; what can be seen by a few but not by most of the ancient creatures that guard the homes forest; the horses.; reminded me a little of the Snow Child.
When a priest Konstantine; comes unwillingly to the village; he decides the people and their old ways and beliefs are an affront to God. That stirs up things better left sleeping; and Vasya will eventually have to intercede with great peril to her life. Vasya is a young woman who can see what most cannot; who can speak to those most cannot and embraces what is known and unknown. Such a wonderful job is done with the sights and sounds; the daily living of those during this time period; from the reaches of Moscow to this village where Vasya lives with her family. The fires; the dangers in the woods; the huge stove the family sleeps on when it is too cold; the author had to have immersed herself not only in this time period but in the old legends and fairy tales.
So different from what I normally read; not a big fantasy fan and I am not sure if this qualifies as fantasy; more a fairy tale with a side of historical fiction. The author never loses sight of the main narrative despite all the strange happenings and I found that amazing. In short I loved this story.

I definitely lost myself in this richly entertaining Russian folklore tale. I was extremely excited to read this one after seeing some early reviews of this book and I was not disappointed! I totally loved the magical journey that this book took me on!
THE BEAR AND THE NIGHTINGALE by KATHERINE ARDEN is an extraordinary; magical; spellbinding; and captivating tale that transported me right into Russia in the 14th century with itâ€™s history; myths; and folklore from this medieval time period.
KATHERINE ARDEN delivers an extremely vivid and atmospheric read here with a very strong; likeable; and fascinating heroine; Vasya.
There was a minor problem that I had with this story though -- which I found a little bit disruptive to the flow for me. Some of the characters were addressed by multiple names and I had to figure out if it was a new character or if it was one that I was already introduced to. Once I figured that out; then it was easy to follow along with all the characters involved and the storyline. There is also a glossary of Russian words with their descriptions in the back of the book that was very helpful to me while reading this book.
To sum it all up; this was an enjoyable; very imaginative; and an extremely interesting novel with a very eye-catching cover that had me totally engrossed in this magical and mystical tale. Would recommend!

Why This Book
I ordered this online many months ago based on the description I'd read in Goodreads. Then a friend of mine; Valerie; was planning to read it. We decided to do a buddy read together earlier this month.
Plot; Characters & Setting
A Russian girl loses her mother and her place in a family. She meets strange creatures who no one else can see. Her father remarries to provide her with a mother figure; then has more children. Something happens in the background where there is a war between religions; people and culture. It's a battle to maintain your village and your family; but also to connect the past with the future.
Approach & Style
I read the paperback version over a two-week period. It's 312 pages or 28 chapters long. Chapters are about 10 to 12 pages; told in third person.
Strengths
It had absolutely beautiful imagery and lyrical prose. You truly feel transported to a new world full of complex characters; interesting plots and high imagination.
There is a lot of great history and views on religion; politics and royalty. You believe you are in Russia dealing with true occurrences and fantastic situations.
Concerns
The language was too confusing for me; often leaving me wonder what was real and what was fantasy. I'm not normally a fantasy reader; so it might have been partially my fault.
Names on the characters change a bit too often; which made it slightly difficult for me to recall who each person was.
Final Thoughts
I had been in a reading slump and was working on the final chapters of my own book. I might have been distracted while reading this one. I wanted to love it; but I didn't. I think it's a strong book; and for that; I settled on a 3 rating. It is good; just not the right match for me.
About Me
For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT. First the book review goes on Goodreads; and then I send it on over to my WordPress blog at https://thisismytruthnow.com; where you'll also find TV & Film reviews; the revealing and introspective 365 Daily Challenge and lots of blogging about places I've visited all over the world.

Because that's Strange the Dreamer.
â€œOn the second Sabbat of Twelfthmoon; in the city of Weep; a girl fell from the sky. Her skin was blue; her blood was red.â€
This is that rare type of book that; while reading; is a constant reminder of why you fell in love with reading in the first place. This book is perfection. This book is a tangible piece of joy. The feeling while reading this is indescribable; but the closest word choice would have to be pure bliss.
This isn't the type of book to come around often. In fact; the last time I felt this was back in 2015 with The Name of the Wind; and the same feeling of guilt from giving other books five star ratings is here again. This book is so much greater than five stars. Yet; this book feels unratable; because how do you rate perfection instead of just feeling at a loss of words because of its awe?
I don't see how anything I'll read in 2017 can beat this. Not A Court of Wings and Ruin; not Tyrant's Throne; not Skullsworn; not All the Crooked Saints; not The Chosen; not anything. Just throw my 2017 anticipation list away; because Strange the Dreamer was all I needed this year.
â€œTwo hundred years ago; there was a storm.â€
I truly believe the best way to go into this book is blind; I wouldn't even read the synopsis; but the basic premise of this story is that we are introduced to an orphan; who has always been ostracized for being different; and he is constantly dreaming of the Unseen City that everyone else has long forgotten. He grows up; and moves locations; but the mystery city is always on his mind. Then; he finally gets confirmation that the Unseen City is very real and very much in need of help.
Surprise mystery after surprise mystery; eloquent word construction after more eloquent word construction; plot twist after plot twist; and you will become so immersed in this world that you will feel like you yourself have lived in the Unseen City all your life.
I will say that this book does have a really strong romance. In fact; it probably has one of the biggest OTPS I've ever read. Like; I'm real invested. Probably too invested. There is also *gasp* sex in this book; and is dealt with in such a realistic and natural way; while also being very believable; because these characters are seventeen-years-old and are discovering their bodies for the first time. But don't go into this expecting A Court of Mist and Fury's sex scenes; but go into this knowing that it is an older YA book with mature themes that are amazingly written. Again; I'm too emotionally invested in these fictional characters.
â€œShe asked in a hesitant whisper; â€œDo you still think Iâ€™m aâ€¦ a singularly unhorrible demon?â€ â€œNo;â€ he said; smiling. â€œI think youâ€™re a fairy tale. I think youâ€™re magical; and brave; and exquisite. Andâ€¦â€ His voice grew bashful. Only in a dream could he be so bold and speak such words. â€œI hope youâ€™ll let me be in your story.â€
âž½ The Plot - This story is so unique; like; take my breath away; how did a human even come up with this; unique. The themes brought up are so important; and the messages will stick with you. The plot is engaging; addicting; and nothing short of phenomenal.
âž½ The Writing - I kind of want to just write ""Laini Taylor is Queen"" and leave it at that. The only other person I can compare her writing style to is Maggie Stiefvater. Lyrical writing speaks to my very soul; but Laini Taylor's craft is so perfected that she weaves these heart stopping; unbelievable lines that are so poetic that just leaves me with my mouth open; my breath gone; and my heart pounding. This writing will make you feel as if you are dreaming; and you'll never confuse it with a nightmare. Laini Taylor's writing is a tier above anything I've ever read. Anything.
âž½ The World - Again; like the plot; the world is so unique and so well crafted. The settings are enough to fill even the most empty of hearts. We have libraries; books upon books; story after story; a mysterious city with an even more mysterious water source running underneath it; mythical armies; demons and angels; domination and salvation. And we have magic; and the magic system in this world is a little random; but learning about all the different possibilities was fascinating. Again; something I became addicted over.
âž½ The Characters - *breaks down in tears* I can't. The two main protagonists of this story; Lazlo and Sarai; are everything you could ever want and then more. They are empathetic; helpful; resistant; persistent; hopeful; even in the most bleak of situations; and capable of unconditional love. This story is also filled with gods and goddesses; a lot of ghosts; and maybe a few monsters. Oh; and moths. How I love the moths.
âž½ The Messages - You can take a lot from Strange the Dreamer; but two messages are very predominant throughout this book. The first message is about race and how we treat and blame others dependent on their skin color based on bad things that other people with that skin color have done. Welcome to America; what ban attempt are we up to now? The next message; and the biggest constant theme of this novel; is that we are not our parent's/ancestor's mistakes. Everyone can change and everyone can be/do better. It is never too late to do good.
â€œSarai was seventeen years old; a goddess and a girl. Half her blood was human; but it counted for nothing. She was blue. She was godspawn. She was anathema. She was young. She was lovely. She was afraid.â€
This book is beyond words with its perfection. I loved every aspect of it; and the only legitimate negative thing I have to say is that Strange the Dreamer makes a very unfortunate abbreviation. And as much as that makes me giggle while taking notes; that's honestly it.
Thank you; Laini Taylor; for a book I will carry in my heart for the rest of my life. This is the best thing I've read in years; and I will never forget this story; these characters; or its message. This book is a love letter to story lovers everywhere; and I recommend this book to everyone with every fiber of my being. Also; I'm buying this for everyone for Christmas; so if you're my friends or family reading this; pretend to be surprised.
No other title in 2018 will come close to the anticipation I feel for The Muse of Nightmares. Please; Lord; help me and my very fragile heart with the wait.

But when did that ever stop any dreamer from dreaming?
Oh hell; it was gorgeous perfection.
I've been away for a while because I'm on vacation; but I just had to step back in and review this completely strange; utterly beautiful book. I've been waiting so long for Laini Taylor to steal my heart once more; and Strange the Dreamer does not disappoint.
It's so tempting when reviewing Taylor's books to talk about the writing style and language. Because it's stunning. I donâ€™t know where the line between purple and beautiful prose should be drawn; but I do know that Laini Taylor stands just on the right side of it. The very sentences themselves feel magical and dreamy; creating an atmosphere that convinces you you've been transported to another world.
There's a timeless fairy tale quality to her writing; too; itâ€™s *almost* too much; *almost* too poetic; and yet somehow it is just perfect. I also particularly loved the running theme of dreamers and dreaming here:
It was why she dared no longer dream: because in her own sleep she was like any dreamer; at the mercy of her unconscious. When she fell asleep; she was no sorceress or dark enthralled; but just a sleeping girl with no control over the terrors within her.
Okay; where was I? See what I mean? You can get all caught up in the writing and lose your trail of thought. But my point was that while it's tempting to go on and on about Taylor's writing; it does a disservice to the fantastic storytelling underneath. Because; personally; you can wax poetic until you're blue in the face; but if I'm not interested in the characters and underlying story/conflicts; I'll be left feeling cold.
No need to worry about that here.
Strange the Dreamer opens with the orphaned Lazlo. Though a big dreamer; he is a junior librarian and; let's face it; probably never going to turn his dreams into anything more than just that. Ah; but no! Because this orphan is about to have his life turned upside down when his biggest; wildest dream comes closer than ever before.
You see; when Lazlo was young; the name of the lost; mythical city was stolen from everyone's minds. He knows he once knew the Unseen City's real name; but the word left in its place is Weep. No matter how he struggles to remember; all he hears is the same old ""Weep"". Obsessed with discovering what happened; he spends his adolescence researching the city; trying desperately to find anything about it; longing to one day visit the city himself.
And; of course; like all bold dreamers of fantasy; he will get a chance to go on a magical journey and maybe; just maybe; make his dreams come true. I won't give away any more than that. This is a fairly long book and many things happen; but it's best to discover them for yourself and on the author's terms.
Strange the Dreamer is so unique in its rich world-building; its wonderfully-conceived story of gods; goddesses; ghosts; magic; romance; secrets and guilt; but there is an old tale lurking beneath - that of the orphaned underdog who wanted to be so much more. And whether it is an unloved boy with a scar; stuck in a closet beneath the stairs; who gets to be a powerful wizard; or a nerdy photographer who gets bitten by a spider and learns to be a hero; this is a story that never ceases to appeal to me.
How nice it is to be reminded that magic and dreams can come true. With some darkness; nightmares and bloodshed along the way; of course.

The Special Edition Illumicrate Box. It's hard to see but this book has Gold Sprayed Edges to go with the cover. We got a few other goodies in the box too as well Muse of Nightmares.

Audio re-read was freaking awesome!
Had to get the UK Version & my bookmark from my favorite place on Etsy. Yay!
This book is amazing! That's just all there is to it. â¤ Laini Taylor is amaze balls!
When I got this beautiful book from UPS I about fell over. It is so freaking beautiful. The cover is so shiny and no amount of pictures can do it justice. You just have to see it for yourself.
This book is so full of everything. How do I even review a book that is all over and made me sad and took me to a strange and mystical world.
Lazlo Strange; whom I love; was an orphan boy who went on an errand to The Great Library and never returned. He loved books and was lost in them until he was found and they just kept him on instead of sending him back to the home. He became a librarian. But he was obsessed with the story of Weep and what happened there. He spent years writing his own journals about the place.
Lazlo was know as ""Strange The Dreamer"" or Lazlo Strange. But he wasn't strange at all and the things he found out helped him later on. Sometimes dreams can come true.
I'm going to Weep; he thought; and could have laughed at the pun; but he kept his composure; and when the Tizerkane warriors rode out of the Great Library and out of Zosma; Strange the dreamer went with them.
I'm not going to give out any kind of spoilers because this is a book you need to discover on your own. It's freaking amaze balls! Did I already say that?
I will say there are a good bit of characters in the book; nothing confusing; but my favorites are Lazlo and Sarai. â¤
Laini Taylor can write some beautiful words.
Weep slept. Dreamers dreamed. A grand moon drifted; and the wings of the citadel cut the sky in two: light above; dark below.
Sarai is something else but I'm not going to tell you what she is and there are others like her. There is a really sad story behind all of that as well. But Sarai is wonderful and kind and different.
Streaming forth into the night; the darkness fractured into a hundred fluttering bits like windblown scraps of velvet. A hundred smithereens of darkness; they broke apart and re-formed and siphoned themselves into a little typhoon that swept down toward the rooftops of Weep; whirling and wheeling on soft twilight wings.
Sarai screamed moths. Moths and her own mind; pulled into a hundred pieces and flung out into the world.
Seriously; if you have wanted to get this book; get it and I hope you love it. I didn't understand every little bit about the book but that's okay because I still loved it. â¤
Of course that ending . . . and there is so much more going on in the book but like I said; you need to read it and feel the magic. I don't even know where Laini Taylor comes up with this stuff. Just the way she writes is surreal.
Now we have to a wait a billion years to get the next one. *Sob*

I TRULY DO NOT HAVE WORDS FOR HOW MUCH BEAUTIFUL PERFECTION THIS BOOK IS. I need more stars to give it omg. I honestly feel like this is the most beautifully written book of ever....the words!??? The marvellous exquisite combination of words just!???? IT SLAYED ME. It's all gods and monsters and librarians and the most lush and gorgeous dream landscapes and I cannnnn't. I just can't with how wholly i loved it. I got to this point reading it and was just like ""I never want this book to end thanks.""
OKAY BUT CAN WE TALK ABOUT LAZLO STRANGE FOR A MINUTE?!? Aka the most precious hufflepuff in existence. He is so sweet and pure and good and lovely and jfadskaldjaklj. I love him. I love how his nose got broken by a fairy tale book and that he'll walk into a wall because he's reading so much and how his whole life is about fantastical lost cities and how he dreams the most beautiful and gorgeous dreams the world has ever known. HE IS PERFECT. And relatable. Because book lover. And also 10/10 for how dorky he was.
The world doesn't deserve the preciousness of Lazlo Strange.
(Also his name is so fabulous.)
(Also he dreams himself dragon wings so also I am Lazlo Strange.)
And I absolutely adored Sarai too; who is a blue-skinned godspawn. She's hiding from the world that wants her dead because of her horrifically cruel goddess mother. But she is pURE and gOOD too. And I just want to give her a cake. She hasn't had a cake in year and goddammit please someone give Sarai a cake.
But what really caught me is the writing. Usually I would be dead with so much flowery prose but I wasn't. I absolutely loved it. It totally swallowed my MIND and I just couldn't stop thinking ""I wnat to live in this book."" Every word was so perfectly chosen that I was devoured by the story. I've never seen a city so clearly as I see Weep. I THINK LAINI TAYLOR MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO TRUE MAGIC. JUST SAYIN'.
This is all about magic and gods and monsters which is 100000% my kind of story. Also dEATh and destruction and psychotic little girls who catch ghosts and legends inside legends and great monsters and beasts and cruel pasts and terrified warriors and god slayers and quiet librarian boys and falling girls with flowers in their hair and -- I JUST -- AJFKDLSAFDJKJKDFSJ.
I do think it's not YA though. I read a fair bit of adult fantasy and this read far more like adult. Plus Lazlo is like 20; so.
And there were a few things that weren't my favourite but I'm kind of like ""OH WHO CARES I STILL ADORE IT WITH ALL MY SOCKS"" to the situation. But:
â€¢ it is rather omnipresent so head-bopping happened a lot
â€¢ and it has a pretty smack-in-the-face dose of instalove
â€¢ except i ship it so bad jafdksld help me
SPOILERS ABOUT LAZLO:
(view spoiler)
You know? I could just flail forever over how much I loved it. I don't even think you should know too much about the storyline; because it's pure perfection to watch it unravel with Lazlo. <3 But honestly I want to read more books with sweet boys and nightmare girls. I want more books that melt my soul with the most fantastically marvellous writing in the world. I want books that make me DREAM and be inspired to greatness. I FEEL LIKE WRITING A THOUSAND FAIRY TALES AND CONQUERING THE MOON AND FLYING AWAY ON DRAGON WINGS NOW. And a book that steals your heart and your imagination is the perfect kind of book.
#obsessed
NOTE: I listened to the audiobook and it worked SO well for me. Usually I read too fast; so I think I woudn't have appreciated the lush detailed writing if I hadn't have gone with the audio. Plus it's Steve West who has a gorgeous accent omg. <3 (And narrated The Scorpio Races as Sean so excuse me while Sean and Lazlo are the same and I'm in love.) (But also I listen to it on 2 x the speed ahem. Otherwise I would've lost at least 87 braincells at how slow he reads.) (less)",245,NEXTBOOK

Somehow; Laini manages it. Probably because she is really; really talented but also I think she might make blood sacrifices to the muses. STRANGE THE DREAMER is a beautiful; unusual; unexpected story which so many great characters that it's very hard for me to pick a favorite. Worldbuilding is intense and wholly original; but still very readable and organic.
The incredible prose made me want to savor every page; but the story hooked me from sentence 1; which made me want to burn through it. In the end; I settled for feverish reading with periods of weeping/prose adoration. I think this was a good system. It's so far my favorite fantasy of 2017; and one of my favs of all time already. Can't wait to read the sequel. Highly highly super YOU MUST READ THIS recommend. (less)",246,NEXTBOOK

This time I actually finished it; I listened to the audiobook; and it was better but still lots of unnecessary filler that prevented me from really getting into the story. Really sad I didn't enjoy it more but oh well; I gave it a fair shot!
*DNF Jan 2017
I never; like literally never; DNF books but this is one that I just couldn't do. I was so incredibly confused the whole time I read it. It was so all over the place I couldn't even bring myself to read any further. DNFed @ pg 150. Rating is obviously based on what I read.

I wonder if anyone with bulky muscular arms is willing to hug me right now; I want to be compressed back to death because Iâ€™ve decided to abandon humanity to become an orb of energy and light instead and just live photogenically until The Muse of Nightmares is out.
â€œBeautiful and full of monsters?â€
â€œAll the best stories are.â€
How much money do you think I should invest in the search for immortality for Laini Taylor to keep her as a story teller forever?
Because gosh; I love her writing and the way she tells her stories so much that my heart actually threatens to break out of my collarbone.
I swear itâ€™s like youâ€™re reading and you can just see yourself sipping champagne on a balcony overlooking Paris at sunset in a silk robe with roses all around and a fountain in the background. Her writing is the equivalent of honey dripping off a spoon over a toasted bagel and I don't know how else to describe it but thereâ€™s just something incredibly soothing about it. Like a memory foam mattress with underfloor heating and you just want to sink in. It's the feeling of wanting to float around as collections of rose petals like the nymphs in narnia. It's your eyelashes stuck together from crying; and lana songs playing and you just want to claw your way out of your body into a warm slipstream and just let the current wash you away.
And you really have no idea how I wish I could tattoo that feeling and carry it around with me forever.
So. What is Strange the Dreamer about?
Itâ€™s a story of a city that lost its name and was lost to the world; of blue-skinned goddesses who appear in the dreams of men and moths who infiltrate their unconsciousness.
Of ghosts bound to a childâ€™s will and orphans who inherited tales of hate; of dragonfly wings purchased in dreams and noses literally broken by fairy tales; of heroes with untold stories or rather stories stolen by imposter heroes.
Of dreamsmiths who â€œturn their nightmares into fireflies and catch them in a jarâ€; of godslayers and great men who are also good men (and the repercussions of being both)
And of beginning that are very literally endings and of a character who â€œcouldnâ€™t have belonged at the library more truly if he were a book himselfâ€.
It's a story I wish I could purchase another heart entirely just to love it with.
The characters:
I love how you can see a little fragment of yourself in Laini Taylor's characters' eyes. Especially when these characters have been fragmented in so many pieces so many times in so many different ways and you can recognize parts of yourself in their anger and guilt and bitterness and loneliness and desire to be more than this (where this translates to everything). In the way theyâ€™re constantly trying to stitch themselves back together and wondering if it will ever be the same Original image; if the pieces will ever fit again.
And if thereâ€™s anything I like more than flawed characters and characters you can relate to; itâ€™s flawed characters that you can relate to.
âœ¨ Lazlo Strange
I can't remember if I had a personality before loving Lazlo Strange but at this point it's quite irrelevant.
Lazlo Strange makes me want to reinvent myself as the concept of kindness and stop glorifying bitterness and saltiness and start promoting the idea of being nice to people â€œsimply because they needed itâ€ (and not necessarily because theydeserve it)
He is the kind of person that is so deeply kind and compassionate that you would listen to them speak and itâ€™s like you're watering your heart and soul garden. And I just can't believe the world isn't catered to making him feel good and content; because let me tell you: being kind and gentle and vulnerable when you have been exposed to less than zero modeling of that behavior is not easy and Lazlo Strange does it every day and honestly?? He can use my body as a canoe and row himself across the toxic waste; he deserves only the softest cashmere.
Letâ€™s not also forget that he's a reader but most importantly heâ€™s a book lover. And I'm sure in an alternate universe; he would pick me up at 3am and have night adventures with me in a desolate library or he and I could be sharing harry potter celebration boxes harmoniously and that would have been perfect.
â€œHe read while he walked. He read while he ate. The other librarians suspected he somehow read while he slept; or perhaps didnâ€™t sleep at all.â€
He's also an introvert. The kind of introvert who's constantly trying to astral project into a library with soft candle lightning and the warm sound of silence. Who gets what it's like to be a lizard person in human skin trying too hard to fit into society but not understanding the appropriate level of eye contact nor how to talk about his passions (books) in a moderate amount.
So hey @universe; when is a certain lazlo strange going to manifest in my life?? [tapping my watch passive aggressively]
âœ¨ Sarai
â€œIt was no small thing to shed a lifetime of nonbeing and suddenly be seen.â€
Sarai is the blue-skinned goddess who infiltrates dreams and turns them into nightmares. Except sheâ€™s also just a child whoâ€™s inherited a story of hate and revenge; like being rendered a solid object with a parental control lock on it.
Which just goes to show you that is so fucked up how much value is placed on family in the sense of blood; when you have at least six genetic twins somewhere around the world but nobody tries to make you feel bad because you donâ€™t love them just because youâ€™re made of the same stuff (or in saraiâ€™s case; because you wouldnâ€™t carry on their petty revenge agenda).
And you know what? I just want to build a spotless and aesthetically pleasing floating citadel with her and go live in it and be sexy goddesses together and do nothing but insert god's fear in the hearts of all men.
âœ¨Sarai x Lazlo
I think my biggest shift in perspective has been going from being aggressively anti-instalove to not giving a fragmented fuck that technically this was insta-love. I just really love these two dorks so much together and I love that they're willing to be unattractive in front of each other. I'm trash for this warm kind of intimacy; tbh.
âœ¨ Thyon Nero
I have a lot of inner conflict regarding thyon because on one hand; I hate him with a casanovian passion; and on the other; I just want to stroke his hair gently because honestly sometimes you just lose track of where â€œtrying to protect yourselfâ€ ends and â€œselfishnessâ€ begins. Sometimes you succumb to jealousy and self-pity and bitterness and you lose track of yourself. Sometimes your defense mechanism kicks in and you hurt before you get hurt.
I feel bad for Thyon but seriously. If he hurts my child (Lazlo); the dealâ€™s off the table.
âœ¨ Minya
How cool is it to get to hang out with ghosts?? (says me who in case sheâ€™s ever had a paranormal experience; sheâ€™ll probably immediately have a heart attack and die)
Except in this scenario; Minya gets said ghost to hang out with her. And by hanging out; I donâ€™t mean teaming up to scare the rude old lady that lives across the street. I mean it in the sense that she catches them like one would catch butterflies in a net and keeps them to do her binding and cede to her every whim.
Which is seven shades of gruesome but I refuse to believe for one second that Minya is just that. Not when I feel like my heart has just been torn into a million pieces and scattered across the desert to be picked at by vultures whenever I think about her and â€œthey were all i could carry; they were all i could carryâ€.
I really just hope everyone sees through her thick armor of bullshit and glimpse the confused and hurt and lonely child inside whoâ€™s only ever wanted to protect her family.
Oh and on a side note; that ending was just pure cruelty; Laini Taylor. Pure fucking cruelty.
Overall: this was awesome and I'd totally recommend it because everyone needs to read this extraordianary fucking book

I honestly still don't know what to rate this; so I'm going with 3.5 stars.
Wow; so it took me nearly two months to finish this book. Here's the thing. The writing quite literally slays; and so does the characterization. My struggle was this: Half the time; I was sitting there in awe; thinking 'This is the best book EVER WRITTEN' ahhh. The other half? I could barely get through a page before falling asleep. There would be pages and pages of descriptions - and while they were mind-blowing; I was dyyinggg for the story to start.
So just a heads up - it takes about halfway or maybe even more for anything to even start happening. The pace didn't pick up until like 80%.
My recommendation? If you're a writer (or aspiring writer) - this is a must read. For sure. But be prepared going into it. I think I've highlighted half the book because of how pretty and raw the sentences were. It was poetic at times and short and raw at others. Such an interesting combination I feel like I've learned a ton and I owe Laini a great deal for that.
Lazlo Strange is easily one of the most tender and relatable characters in YA lit. He was precious down to the bone; and I swear I don't think anyone could read about him and not fall in love. From the very first page; too. He sucks you in quick. His fascination of 'Weep' becomes the reader's fascination of weep. It's impossible not to feel Lazlo's emotions.
As far as the other characters - same deal. They all felt real. I loved Sarai even though she didn't have a huge personality. Her abilities are super dark but super cool and I was totally rooting for her. I also liked to see the interaction with the other... 'gods' or whatever they were. I love how they each had distinguishable personalities. What I didn't love? Their POV talking about next to nothing.
Anyway; like I said; the pacing is extremely slow and I think the characters are the entire reason I stuck around. If it hadn't been for them; I would have just picked it up occasionally to get some writing inspiration.
The world building was also phenomenally done; (albeit weird at times with the metal thing). But cool. Okay; does anyone remember watching 'The Little Princess' as a kid? That movie was what spurred my obsession with Indian Folklore. I would chain watch that movie over and over again because of the blue goddess love story and ahhhh this book brought back memories of that and of other stories I used to love. Ugh see? This is my issue. I would have loved this book so much more -perhaps even cried over it- if the pacing had been better.
So here I sit with mixed feelings. So much greatness. So much brilliance. And yet it took me months to get through it.
Take what you will from that!

â€œAll the best stories are.â€
Love that feeling when you start a series and immediately realize there's no going back to normal.
Actual footage of me entering this fandom:
There were SO many elements of this story that really worked for me (MINUS THE SO-CALLED LOVE!!!)
Lazlo Strange; an orphaned child; was always fascinated by tales of the missing city - he would make-believe all sorts of adventures.
One day; while playing alone in the monastery orchard; something wondrous and terrible happened.
The name of the city was snatched out of his head and replaced with Weep.
He spends every waking moment obsessed with finding out what happened - when suddenly; years later; someone from that very city visits...
Lazlo sacrifices everything to follow that man back to the city of Weep - it's not every day that your dreams come true.
It was impossible; of course. But when did that ever stop any dreamer from dreaming.
Meanwhile; Sarai is Godspawn - child of the immortal and mortal - only years ago; the mortals rebelled and slain every last God and Godspawn...or so they thought.
Sarai and her other Godspawn spent the last few decades hiding on the floating city. They were children; still in their diapers when the great slaughter happened.
She spent her childhood half-staved; unbearably isolated and completely on their own.
She's a teenager; along with the other surviving Godspawn; and it's becoming increasingly difficult to hide their presence...especially when the humans are bound and determined to take down the floating city.
A chance encounter between Lazlo and Sarai sparks something that neither of them could ever have anticipated...
Overall - this one swept me off of my feet.
I loved the wild and whimsical world Liani Taylor created - the odd magic; the alien-ness of the Godspawn; the simple joys of Lazlo the librarian-turned-adventurer.
The only thing that threw me out of this novel was the love - it was absolutely terrible.
If the rest of the book wasn't so good; I would've one-starred this one based on the awful love story.
Most of the book centers around backstory of both Lazlo and Sarai and how they came to be in the same city.
Then; they make eye-contact in a dream - BOOM - eternal love and devotion.
It's just like...come on. Taylor wrote such a rich; complex and absolutely beautiful story...and then throws together a half-assed ""love"" story.
It's like; she got to almost the end and was like; ""oh sh*t. I forgot to make the characters fall in love. Where's my shoe-horn?""
Did I mention that the romance ""develops"" over the course of two nights - entirely through dreams? Without seeing that relationship build; it just seems eye-rollingly-ridiculous.
Really put me off of reading the second book. I'll still read it; because I'm in love with this amazing world; but I am crossing my fingers that the romance calms itself down.

Dream up something wild and improbable;"" she pleaded. ""Something beautiful and full of monsters.""
â€œBeautiful and full of monsters?""
â€œAll the best stories are.â€
This quote is basically a short summary of the entire book because â€œStrange the Dreamerâ€ is indeed a story about something beautiful and full of monsters. Well; actually some might even say itâ€™s a story about â€œbeautiful monsters"" and you certainly would be more than just right to put it that way. ;-)
Those beautiful monsters appear in all different kinds of shapes and forms and no matter how hard I would try; Iâ€™m convinced I still wouldnâ€™t be able to express how much I loved to read this book. It was magical; it was moving; it was so very different than anything else Iâ€™ve ever read. Laini Taylorâ€™s writing is like poetry and it drew me in and left me wanting for more. This world was so intriguing; itâ€™s characters so flawed and mysterious and itâ€™s power so raw. There was so much pain; mistrust; hate; despair and fear. But there was also hope; trust; the flutter of wings; dreams and love. Always love.
Desperate love; hopeless love; guilty love; unrequited love; motherly love; hopeful love; destructive love; young love; old love; dying love; love in every form.
I think I could go on and on with this one. *lol* Suffice it to say that it was wonderful to read; amazing to experience and heart-breaking to witness. Such a perfect bookâ€¦ such a compelling story. Well done; Laini. Well done! <3
The Plot:
â€There were two mysteries; actually: one old; one new. The old one opened his mind; but it was the new one that climbed inside; turned several circles; and settled in with a grunt â€“ like a satisfied dragon in a cozy new lair. And there it would remain â€“ the mystery; in his mind â€“ exhaling enigma for years to come.â€
This quote is everything youâ€™ll get from me when it comes to the plot; because itâ€™s so complex I couldnâ€™t write a summary without giving away some major spoilers. ;-) All I can say is: Read the book. Just read it. Iâ€™m sure it will blow your mind. XD
The Characters:
And here it is; my infamous spoilery spoiler section. XD If you havenâ€™t read the book yet and donâ€™t want to be spoiled you should leave now. If you already read the book and want to hear my thoughts: Welcome to the lionâ€™s den. *lol* Take a seat and a cookie. ;-P
Lazlo:
â€The library knows its own mind;â€ old Master Hyrrokkin told him; leading him back up the secret stairs. â€œWhen it steals a boy; we let it keep him.â€
Lazlo couldnâ€™t have belonged to the library more truly if he were a book himself.
This boy is so sweet; innocent; amazing and pure. Seriously; I think he might be the purest soul I ever had the pleasure to read about. I love him; I just love him so much!! <33 Lazlo is one hell of a precious bean and all I wanted to do was to protect him from every possible threat and harm that might come his way. He needs to be protected at all costs!!! I mean heâ€™s basically a unicorn and unicorns need to be happy and safe! I just loved how he always tried to see the good in people; how he gave them everything and didnâ€™t even expect anything in return. He was so altruistic and generous it was so beautiful to watch. He never judged. He just listened to all the different sides and he accepted every opinion even if his own differed. In short: If the world would have more Lazlo Strangeâ€™s then it definitely would be a better place. =)) Which is the reason why Iâ€™m so damn worried about him right now. That ending!!! T_T I really hope he wonâ€™t lose his innocenceâ€¦. Please Laini; let him be okay; donâ€™t allow Minya to corrupt him and to turn him into something bad. *sobs*
â€If the dream chose the dreamer; then his had chosen poorly. It needed someone far more daring than he. It needed the thunder and the avalanche; the war cry and the whirlwind. It needed fire.â€
â€Who had ever expended so much passion on a dream; only to stand helpless as it was granted to others? Others; moreover; who had expended no passion on it at all. His impossible dream had; against all probability; crossed deserts and mountains to come to Zosma and extend an unprecedented invitation.
But not to him.â€
â€He had loved the library; and had felt; as a boy; as though it had a kind of a sentience; and perhaps loved him back. But even if it was just walls and a roof with papers inside; it had bewitched him; and drawn him in; and given him everything he needed to become himself.â€
Sarai:
I kiss dozens of people every night.â€ And she touched a spot just above the outer curve of one cinnamon eyebrow. â€œRight here. Men and women; babies and grandparents. I kiss them and they shudder.â€ Her voice was like ice; and so were her hearts. â€œI kiss them and they grieve.â€
She was such a strong character! I loved that Sarai was so empathic and thought out of the box. After everything she went through she still stood by her convictions and refused to give herself to hatred and wrath. I think itâ€™s admirable that she tried to understand the citizens of Weep and dared to hope that peace was possible. I mean she knew that both sides did awful things; but she was also aware that it were mistakes and atrocities other people had done. She was nothing but a baby when the gods fell and even though Minya kind of bullied her into hurting the people of Weep she still knew that her actions were wrong. She wanted to stop the destructive cycle of hate; mistrust; prejudices and fear and Iâ€™m sure if the ending wouldnâ€™t have happened Lazlo and her might have even had a realistic chance to succeed. *sighs* Gosh; I hate that ending! Did I already mention that I hate that ending? >_<
â€Sarai wasnâ€™t going to kill anyone. She was stubborn; very; and she wasnâ€™t about to surrender her decency or mercy for a sound dayâ€™s sleep. She wouldnâ€™t beg Minya for lull. Whatever happened she would never again serve Minyaâ€™s twisted will.â€
â€Good people do all the things bad people do; Lazlo. Itâ€™s just that when they do them; they call it justice.â€ She paused. Her voice grew heavy. â€œWhen they slaughter thirty babies in their cradles; they call it necessary.â€
Eril-Fane:
â€Even after all these years; the thought of Isagol the Terrible stirred such a storm in him â€“ of rancor and longing; desire and disgust; violence and even affection â€“ all of it seething and bleeding and writhing; like a pit of rats eating one another alive. That was what his feelings were now; what Isagol had made of them. Nothing good or pure could survive in him. All was corruption and gore; suffocating in his self-loathing. How weak he was; how pitiful. He might have killed the goddess in the end; but he wasnâ€™t free of her; and he never would be.â€
Ohh Eril-Fane; the guy with one of the coolest nicknames in all history. Godslayer. Sounds awesome! Has a certain ring to it; right? If you consider what had to happen to get that nickname itâ€™s not that cool anymore though. Well; actually it loses all its glory. Boy; was he a tormented and tortured soul. I loved it! *lol* Yeah; I know you might roll your eyes now and say: Gin; why do you always love those flawed characters and villains? The answer is simple. They are complex; they are interesting; and they intrigue me. Immensely I might add. ;-P So back to Eril-Fane. What a fascinating personality. Devoured by rancor and love; torn between duty and self-hatred; eroded by years of shame and despondency; eaten by guilt and longing. Ahh; whatâ€™s not to love? *lol* Heâ€™s everything I want in a character and Laini Taylor wrote him so well! I just want more of him and I canâ€™t wait for book two!!
â€Eril-Fane had his own arsenal of horrors; he hardly needed hers. Fear was the last of it. Sarai hadnâ€™t understood before that fear could be the lesser torment. It was shame that tore him apart. It was despair. There was no darkness she could send him to rival what heâ€™d endured already. He had lived three years with Isagol the Terrible. He had survived too much to be driven mad by dreams.â€
â€He loved her so much;â€ she whispered. â€œIt was all a lie. It was a violation. But it didnâ€™t matter; did it; because when Isagol made you feel something; it became real. He hated her. And he loved her. And he killed her.â€
â€He looked him right in the eyes and saw a man who was great and good and human; who had done extraordinary things and terrible things and been broken and reassembled as a shell; only then to do the bravest thing of all: He had kept on living; though there are easier paths to take.â€
Minya:
â€They were all I could carry. They were all I could carry.â€
There was no echo; no reverberation. If anything; the room ate sound. It swallowed her voice; her words; and her eternal; inadequate apology. But not her memories. She would never be rid of those.â€
I FREAKING HATE MINYA!!! There; I said it; itâ€™s out now! I understand why she is so angry at the people of Weep and I can see why sheâ€™s craving for revenge but I do NOT understand why she has to use other people in order to get what she wants. To turn on Sarai and Lazlo? Thatâ€™s where I draw the line. No matter how much Iâ€™m sorry for what she experienced and how much it hurt and shaped her; I still canâ€™t forgive her what she did in the end!! I mean Sarai is her family; she doesnâ€™t know Lazlo; okay; but Sarai?! She raised her!!! She rescued her and took care of her over those years. Sheâ€™s basically like a mother figure even though sheâ€™s barely a few years older and still looks like a child. Minya is so wrathful and embittered that she sees nothing but hatred and vengeance and even though I know that sheâ€™s pulling the strings right now; I still hope that Lazlo and Sarai wonâ€™t end up being her puppets. =(( URGH I just dislike her so much! T_T
The ships:
Sarai & Lazlo:
â€There was no one behind her. There was no one else at all. The whole dream shrank to a sphere around the pair of them; and there could be no question that the witchlight was for her; or that it was her he meant when he whispered; with vivid and tender enthrallment; â€œWho are you?â€
Those two were so damn cute together!!! GAH! I canâ€™t even. From the very first moment they met up until to their dream dates they were just perfection! I loved how hard they fell for each other and yes; I know that was kinda insta-lovey but it was executed so damn well. I mean sometimes this just happens. You meet someone and you fall head over heels. You donâ€™t question if itâ€™s too fast; you donâ€™t think about the future; you just live in the moment and breathe every second youâ€™re in that persons proximity. They give you life; they make you happy; they cause you to wear a permanent grin on your face. And BOY did Laini Taylor do a good job at conveying that feeling! It felt like I was with them; falling in love too. <3 BUT that damn ending!!! ARGH!!! I hate Minya for being so cruel; I hate that the citadel lost balanceâ€¦ I just hate everything that happened in those last few chapters. T_T I want them to be happy but I donâ€™t see how this can work out goodâ€¦ I mean Sarai is basically Minyaâ€™s hostage now and Lazlo loves her so much. The next book is going to hurt. This just broke my heartâ€¦ >_< *sobs*
â€I think you are a fairy tale. I think youâ€™re magical; and brave; and exquisite. And â€¦ â€œ His voice grew bashful. Only in a dream could he be so bold and speak such words. â€œI hope youâ€™ll let me be in your story.â€
â€Lazlo did hold Sarai in his arms that night; and she was real and flesh; blood and spirit; but not laughter. Not breath. Those had left her body forever.
The Muse of Nightmares was dead.â€
Azareen & Eril-Fane:
â€She curved herself against his back; laid her face to the side of his neck; and wept the tears that he could not. Eril-Fane shuddered as her tears seared his skin; and something inside him gave way. He pulled her arms tight against his chest and crushed his face into her hands. And then; and there; for everything lost and everything stolen; both from him and by him in all these long years; the Godslayer started to sob.â€
I really wish those two would have gotten a chance to be happy; but as it seems the scars of their pasts ruined everything they could have been. Poor Azareen! To love her husband; to see his torture but to be unable to help him; to be incapable of saving him from the darkness thatâ€™s clutching at his tormented soul. It hurt to read about them and it hurt to see them so broken. No one in this story was truly bad; they all were just a product of the gods and what they did to them; so yeah. I felt sorry for Azareen and Eril-Fane; but that quote above gives me hope. Maybe theyâ€™ll manage to find each other in the next book? =) Thereâ€™s always hope; right?
Conclusion:
I loved this book!!! â€œStrange the Dreamerâ€ was a wonderful and surprisingly awesome read and I canâ€™t wait until â€œThe Muse of Nightmaresâ€ is released! I need to know how it continues and what is going to happen next!!! I just need to know! XD
So until the book is finally hitting the stores Iâ€™ll just try to hold on to this quote:
â€And thatâ€™s how you go on. You lay laughter over the dark parts. The more dark parts; the more you have to laugh. With defiance; with abandon; with hysteria; any way you can.â€
Also a big thanks to The Awesome Rusty!!! It was amazing to buddy read with you and I hope weâ€™ll do this again! *lol* This truly was a buddy read match made in heaven because for some reason we always managed to be on the same page. Haha! I donâ€™t know how we did this; but we must have some sort of superpower that linked us together and caused us to sync whenever it was needed. XD
Well; however we did it; it was certainly one of the most comfortable buddy reads I ever had the pleasure to experience. Rusty; you rock! ;-) (less)",252,NEXTBOOK

laini taylor is a straight-up godsend. sheâ€™s masterful at writing characters you care about; at building worlds down to the dust in the corner of a room; at creating conflicts that are analogous to a readerâ€™s experiences despite being set in imaginary realms populated by creatures not-quite-human; and sheâ€™ll rip your heart out with zero regrets.
this book opens with the death of a character youâ€™ve never met; so your heart stays right where it is; and then it schoomps back in time and youâ€™re deep into a hundred or so pages following the story of a dreamy booknerd named lazlo strange (dreamy like â€œstrange the dreamer;â€ not dreamy like [insert name of whatever celebrity is considered to be dreamy these days]) and his devotion to reading all the books; with an especial attraction to fairytales and stories about â€œthe unseen city;â€ a land so far and mysterious that it has become the stuff of legend - warriors and creatures and magic; a city whose true name vanished from memory in an instant and is now known as weep. and this segment is all packed with details of war and lazloâ€™s obscure origins and his place within his world and magic and alchemy and unexpected opportunity and how books broke his nose and changed his life and by the time you meet up with the character whose death you witnessed in the prologue; youâ€™re inundated with minutia and have half-forgotten that even happened.
but the other half remembers; and the more you get to know her; the more you donâ€™t want to care too much about her as a character; because you know where this road ends. itâ€™s no fun - braced for the inevitable thing thatâ€™s coming while the characters are themselves unaware; wanting there to be a creative loophole that will make things seem less â€¦final.
itâ€™s like how sean of the house came home when i was bingewatching OITNB season 5 and hung out for a bit and now that heâ€™s joined me on my complete series rewatch; heâ€™s already prepared for the death of a beloved someone that shocked us all when it happened; and now heâ€™s in that uncomfortable position of knowing who but not when or how; and heâ€™s not gonna feel the heartpunch as much as if he had just watched the show with me from the beginning; as i beseeched him to do.
seeing the future has never been something to envy; powerball aside.
overall; i didnâ€™t love this as much as i loved the daughter of smoke and bone trilogy; which is still one of the best things iâ€™ve ever read; particularly that middle book. there were times here when i thought her trademark poetical flourishes were strained and some of the banter was too cutesy; and it took a while to get going; but itâ€™s still SO. DAMN. GOOD.
because she ended it with a frigginâ€™ surgical strike to the feels.
just when you thought you were safe - when the thing you knew was gonna happen happened and youâ€™re comforting yourself by googling silver linings and lemonade recipes for all these sour sour lemons; thatâ€™s when laini taylor swoops in and rips your heart out for real; and sheâ€™s all; â€œsucks to your lemonade; son!â€
itâ€™s like that line from Night Film:
Just when you think you've hit rock bottom; you realize you're on another trapdoor.
i am so ready for the second part of this.
******************************************
the aftermath of a war between gods and men.
a mysterious city stripped of its name.
a mythic hero with blood on his hands.
a young librarian with a singular dream.
a girl every bit as dangerous as she is in danger.
alchemy and blood candy; nightmares and godspawn; moths and monsters; friendship and treachery; love and carnage.
on the one hand; that kind of sounds like drunk mad libs.
on the other hand; i LOVE drunk mad libs.

Drafted attempt; mind you. I mean; I will try and somewhat make this cohesive. But nothing will of course do it justice. For that; you will have to discover this story.
This book made me feel hopeful. Validated my views and feelings Iâ€™ve always known to be true to my own self. Then Laini Taylor comes along and drops this bomb of a magic on us and my feelings were cemented by a ten-fold.
Lazlo Strange is a bookworm. A librarian and a dreamer at heart. His fascination with a lost city has been his driving force for majority of his life. Growing up as an orphan in a city that didnâ€™t really accept him; that is what he became fixated on. He lived and breathed books and learning about the city and wonders of Weep.
The way his character was fleshed out was simply stunning. It wasn't just fleshed out; every emotion and thought process the character could have possibly experienced was laid out. Similarly; the same attentive care and focus was given to the other incredible characters and their world; fed to us bit by bit and it beautifully coming together; piece by piece. It allowed me to savour the story; enjoy the dream I was living in for a while and experience it in its full glory.
This is the sort of writing style that demands and deserves attention. It is not to be rushed; and the reader themselves wouldn't want to rush it. Taking your time with it and revelling in its lushness is when the magic happens.
As soon as I entered the story; I was immediately swept away by the language; the intricacy. The attention to detail is mind-blowing and I couldn't help but have such deep admiration for Laini Taylor. I was dreaming whilst reading; building the fantasy up in my head; wandering around in that world; and it all felt so alive to me.
One of the main aspects of the book that I absolutely appreciated was how it looked at the concept of dreams. Thereâ€™s always this debate as to whether it is healthier to be realistic or dream when it comes to your goals as dreamers themselves are looked asâ€¦ â€lazyâ€™. But this book was based on a dreamer and his dream. How he wished; hoped and how much of that dream encompassed his life and regardless of whether people were dismissing it; he still held on to his fire and did not doubt it. Yes; the occasional doubt was there; naturally it would be; but his belief in that dream kept him afloat. And that just hit so close to home for me.
I want to say more about this book. I want to be able to explain the absolute magic it encompassed and honed within me; the comforting emotions I was feeling throughout and the false sense of security I was duped into believing and led to; because that ending was just heart-wrenching. But I actually canâ€™t. And we all know it is a mark of a remarkable book when it leaves you loss for words.

INITIAL REACTION!
Well; fuck. I think my soul has just left my body. RTC when it decides to join me again.

READING RAMBLES.
Okay; I'm feeling guilty for having to put this book down for the 2nd time now. –––
In no way is it bad. At all. 'Bad' and 'Laini Taylor' don't exist in the same universe; but I haven't touched this book for a month and it's mainly due to the fact that I haven't been in the mood to read fantasy for so long. © Soon; babe. I'll get to you soon.

That's really the heart of what every reader desires in a fantasy world; right? Where there is no great risk; there is nothing worth losing; and where there is nothing worth losing; there is nothing worth reading. Perhaps that is the pinnacle of this book's excellence; but it's certainly not it's only great feature. I knew from the moment I dove in that this story would be special; the three pages of prologue were more beautiful; captivating; and gripping than the entirety of many books I've previously read. I could go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on about the quality; structure; and exquisite nature of the writing; but I won't. I think it's been duly noted in most reviews that the dreamy state of writing creates an unparalleled atmosphere to enhance our experience within such a delicate fantasy world. I would liken it to ""calligraphy; if calligraphy were written in honey.""
""Vengeance... Vengeance ought to be spoken through gritted teeth; spittle flying; the cords of one's soul so entangled in it that you can't let it go; even if you try.""
THE PLOT
Best if you go into this knowing as little as possible; but for readers who need something to go on; there is a multi-layered plot that plays with the mind and the heart here. The beginning; after the prologue; is a slow building form of storytelling where we spend time getting to know Lazlo Strange and his part in this epic tale. Much emotion and feeling is infused here; I found this to be vital to the story as it forged my bond with Strange and welded my needs; hopes; and dreams with his own. Along the way; we are introduced to a new viewpoint where a similar form of storytelling is relayed. Once the two voices connect and intertwine; the pacing picks up and I really flew through to the end. While I would say this was easy to put down; I don't mean that in a negative way; this was simply a novel I wanted to savor and not rush through. I was able to completely immerse myself in this fantasy world and was thinking about it constantly throughout my day; but I felt comfortable doing this with no pressure to sneak around and cram in a few pages every spare second I had.
(view spoiler)
THE CHARACTERS
We find out the above spoiler fairly early on; which I'm assuming pertains heavily to the next book as well; but I wanted to block it out for those who want no information. While there is quite a bit of action in the final 75 pages or so; the majority of the book is epic characterization and faultless world building. The atmosphere is simultaneously whimsical and bleak; it was equal parts bleary loss and gleaming hope. It felt strange and wonderful to be a part of something so unique as it truly contained a dreamlike; wispy quality; whereas most fantasy I've read does not contain this aesthetic. Even the scenes at the end featuring war; cruelty; and violence contained that lighter; more beautiful aesthetic. Oh no! She's headed back to talking about the prose! Watch out! Seriously; this writing is otherworldly.
""She didn't take away his conflicting emotions; although she could have. She left his hate there; right beside the love. It was the hate of the used and tormented; who are the children of the used and tormented... And it was love. Love that sets forth the soul like springtime and ripens it like summer. Love as rarely exists in reality...""
I'll wrap this up; but I honestly was broken by that ending in the best possible way. If you haven't read the book; then pick it up immediately. It truly deserves all of the stars. If you have; then I'm sure we are all in agreement that (view spoiler) Some of the finest writing I have had the pleasure of experiencing all year and easily my favorite fantasy to date; I highly recommend you read this. <3

Lazlo Strange; abandoned orphan and bibliophile librarian; has nurtured an interest in fairy tales and legends since he was a boy. His secret passion is studying the language and lore of the lost city of Weep. Lazlo believes he'll never be brave enough to search for the forgotten city; but when a heroic figure known as the Godslayer arrives at his village in search of aid; the opportunity to cross the world is suddenly within his grasp.
Strange the Dreamer offers the same luscious and imaginative prose one can always anticipate from a novel written by Laini Taylor.
The black trees danced. His breath-ghost scudded away on a gust; only to be replaced by another. His shadow played out huge before him; and his mind gleamed with ancient wars and winged beings; a mountain of melted demon bones and the city on the far side of it - a city that had vanished in the mists of time.
One [dress] had a skirt like a cage carved of whalebone; another a long train made of hundreds of doves' wings all stitched together. There was a bodice of pure molded gold; made to look like a beetle's carapace; and a fan collar fashioned from the spines of poisonous fish; with tiny teeth sewn in patterns like seed pearls. There were headdresses and veils; corsets with daggers concealed in the stays; elaborate capes; and teetering tall shoes carved of ebony and coral.
There's a considerable amount of foundational exposition and world building; as this is the first book in a new series; but the author finds a delicate balance between introducing readers to a new world with never-before-seen mythical creatures and delivering a complete story with a cast of intriguing characters. While Lazlo makes for a likable and refreshing protagonist; he's accompanied by a batch of equally alluring characters such as a tricky alchemist; a sage monk; a sly thief; and a blue-skinned goddess; to name a few.
This book is a mixed bag of everything readers want from an epic fantasy: magic and whimsy; a fresh take on supernatural abilities; a compelling mystery; an undeniable sense of exploration and adventure; a new realm of fantastical proportions; and a satisfying ending that sets the stage for more to come.
Locales are easy to visualize in one's mind; character motivations sing with truth; and the electric thrill of young love is portrayed with velvet language:
There was a dusting of nearly invisible freckles on the bridge of her nose. The glide of their faces was as slow as poured honey; and her lips. Ever so slightly; they parted. The bottom one; voluptuous as dew-bright fruit; parted from its fellow - for him - and it was the most enticing thing he'd ever seen. A blaze of desire surged through him and he leaned into the honey-slowness; pushing the hopelessness out of his way to take that sweet; soft lip between his own.
A dazzling start to an exhilarating new series; Strange the Dreamer offers beauty and wonder; magic and mysticism; monsters and gods. (less)",259,NEXTBOOK

Every once in awhile I enjoy a paranormal/fantasy type of story; but it definitely isn't my go-to genre. Yet; Laini Taylor has managed to suck me in once again. The beauty of her words and the vivid imagery that she creates never ceases to amaze me.
This book centers on Lazlo Strange; aka ""Strange the Dreamer"". An orphan; he has never really had a home or felt like he fit in. The closest he's come to a sense of normalcy is during his time in the Great Library. He grows up to become a librarian; submersing himself in the stories that he loves so much.
More than anything else; he is captivated by tales of the ""unseen city"". He remembers hearing the stories about the city and the travelers that used to return from having crossed over the city's borders. Then one day; the city seemed to be forgotten. Unlike everyone else in his town; Lazlo remembers the feeling of having his memory of the name of the city pulled away from him. In it's place is the name ""Weep"".
When a mythical hero; the Godslayer; arrives in town; Lazlo is able to join the group on their quest for Weep. This is his biggest dream come to life. He finally has a chance to see the legendary city that he's only fantasized about.
What awaits Lazlo is more than he had imagined. Mythical beings; age-old grudges and a history that melded the worlds of gods and men. As more of Weep's past is unearthed; the brutality of the city's past is brought to light. Lazlo is forced to look at the city and it's inhabitants through a new lens.
Although Lazlo was the central focus for much of this story; Ms. Taylor provides a robust cast of characters. Each member of this large cast brings something special to the story. I don't want to say too much for fear that I might spoil this story for others.
Sarai is such a character. Her relationship with Lazlo is essential to the progression of the plot. From his dreams to his reality; Lazlo could not have found a better match than Sarai. They made each other better for having known one another. Their relationship was sweet and innocent; but also intense and emotional. I loved watching their bond evolve and seeing how their actions changed how they viewed the ""outside"" world.
From start to finish; this was an entertaining and captivating story. Laini Taylor's writing is poetic. You can't help but notice the beauty of her prose.
I listened to the Audible version of this book and it was well-narrated. My only criticism is that it was a bit hard to follow at first. This author's works are multifaceted and incredibly detailed. At first; this can be a bit difficult to follow when listening. I did have to rewind a few times in the beginning to keep my characters and events straight. However; I was able to get it all sorted out pretty soon and I wouldn't trade the richness of the story for the small amount of time lost.
Overall; I thought that this was a wonderful story! I would definitely recommend it; whether you're a die-hard fan of paranormal/fantasy or if you're just an occasional dabbler; like me. Laini Taylor has created a fantastical and intriguing world. I am looking forward to seeing where this series will go.

Peculiar. Resplendent. Gripping.
These are just a couple of words that race through my mind when I consider Strange the Dreamer.
Laini Taylor has solidified her spot as one of my favorite authors with this release.
I am unapologetically in love with her style of writing. I am a shameless worshiper of her artistry for willing forth magnificent worlds & characters & scenarios from her pen.
I devour her books like oxygen.
Before I get ahead of myself; I want to mention that I did notice some small things that bothered me here and there; which I will detail later.
However; I still chose to give this book a 5 stars because overall I don't feel those issues weigh enough to affect my rating.
This is one of the richest worlds we have seen from Taylor yet.
We focus mostly on the city of Weep; but the story is crafted in such a way that it suggests magnitude beyond that focus. It's crafted from a bloody; fantastical history. It's teeming with science & lore & magic.
This is the type of world I savor.
""Beautiful; and full of monsters.""
I appreciate the intense degree of characterization in this novel. I got such a well-formed picture for each character in my mind while I read; especially our two main characters; Lazlo and Sarai.
Lazlo is a tender-hearted librarian; and entirely consumed by his whimsical imagination. His dreams and benevolence run as deep as the ocean; and I tripped and fell head over heels for him almost immediately.
Strange the Dreamer.
Sarai is a solemn; intelligent godspawn. She is woven from the material of conflict; light and darkness spun into the form of a young woman. She is at war with her own compassion; experiencing both hatred & empathy for the opposing sides of a war she almost didn't survive.
The Muse of Nightmares.
I believed in both of these characters. I was never bored with either perspective. I was ravaging my fingernails while waiting to see how this dreadfully exquisite plot would unravel.
This story is much more than the sum of its parts.
It's about the ferocity of love & hope. It's about the persistence of hatred & prejudice. It's about underestimating people; and overestimating people; and finding out whether or not we are capable of forgiveness.
As for my issues; of course we do see a small bit of insta-love. It was not a glaring problem. Taylor's style of writing and depth of characterization almost always keep my suspension of disbelief intact.
Reading the about Lazlo and Sarai gave me that giddy; fresh love; honeymoon infatuation feeling you get when you first begin seeing someone.
Your heart flutters & your breath hitches and the pure potential for a spectacular love leaves you glowing.
And so just like with the Daughter of Smoke and Bone series; I found it easy to excuse any insta-love hints I may have seen.
Also; the pacing for the first 70% of the book was rather slow but if you know anything about me; I'm almost never bothered by a slow pace.
I actually prefer it because I feel it gives the author a chance to properly introduce and provide adequate details for the story they're writing.
Objectively though; I can see where some may feel it was too slow.
But this book was everything for me. Laini Taylor is the kind of artist who inspires me to want to create and add something beautiful to this world.
I adore this book & I want nothing more than to get my hands on the next one.
This and other reviews of mine can be found on Book Nest!

Not the kind of goddess who brings despair to your spirit; but the kind who appeases it with angelic words.
If you remember; this bookâ€™s publication date was postponed. It was released in March of 2017; but was supposed to hit the shelves months before.
I; like many others; was heartbroken when I got the news. I was even annoyed. How dare Laini Taylor do this to us? How dare she tease us in such a way?
Well. I can say; from the bottom of my heart; that all is forgiven. If the story had been tremendously bad; I could have held a grudge maybe; but itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s tremendously original; well-written; magical and romantic.
There is everything you could possibly want from a fantasy tale: a carefully-constructed world-building with its own history and culture; developed charactersâ€”villains; heroes; and those in-betweenâ€”; lush descriptions that speak of Laini Taylorâ€™s way with words and passionate mind; as well as a forbidden love story that will be the focus of your dreams tonight.
What is it about forbidden love that awakens my soul? Is it the secrecy of it? Or is it the intensity of the emotions of the two beings feeling them? Or the fact that it seems as though the whole world is against you; and yet you need no one but the person next to you?
Yes; I am turning to mush. Please donâ€™t step on me. I am at my most vulnerable state.
Thereâ€™s nothing else I want more right now than to plunge into the sequel. Nothing else. Who cares if one of my most anticipated 2018 books just came out? Not I.

âDream up something wild and improbable. Something beautiful and full of monsters.âž
I finally get it. I get the shrines built for Laini Taylor; the adoration of her faithful fans; because after diving into her whimsical and peculiar stories of boys and girls consumed by hunger; swallowing fairy tales and miracles and plums; dreaming big and loving tenderly and passionately; not worshipping her is not an option. Itâ€™s a reflective response. I canâ€™t tell you the exact moment I got lost in her words; I can only tell you that I never recovered.
âIt was the first week of Twelfthmoon; on the far side of Elmuthaleth; and Strange the dreamer â€“library stowaway and scholar of fairy tales â€“ had never been thirstier; or more full of wonder.âž
Full of wonder is the perfect description of how I felt while reading Strange the Dreamer; full of yearning; of an insatiable need to taste and touch and feel the world Laini Taylor created. To live inside it; to savor it in my tongue and bask in the otherworldliness and the warmth that enveloped me. I was incorporeal; weightless; trailing behind Lazlo; flying among moths; smelling leather-bound tomes; strolling along colorful gardens; torn between dreams and nightmares. Blue skin; crimson blood; golden domes; were all I could see. I was ephemeral and eternal and I knew; with absolute clarity; that this little piece of magic will always hold a special place in my heart.
âThe dream chooses the dreamer; not the other way around.âž
Strange the Dreamer is the story of a librarian who was fortunate enough to accomplish his heartâ€™s greatest desire; to see the mythic lost city of Weep; and to gather evidence of magic. Itâ€™s the story of the Muse of Nightmares; a girl banished from the world for the crimes of her mother; but found compassion for the ones who wronged her. Itâ€™s the story of a hero who was also a butcher. A golden son who could not grasp the concept of kindness. A girl who was stuck in the past and wished to avenge the dead by causing a second massacre. Itâ€™s the story of gods and monsters and men; of heroic villains and villainous heroes; of pure love; heinous crimes and; in the end; acceptance.
âHe read while he walked. He read while he ate. The other librarians suspected he somehow read while he slept; or perhaps didn't sleep at all.âž
There is no character I have cherished more than Lazlo Strange; I identified with him; with the physical attraction to books and pages and lores and tales to the very marrow. His quest to find magic; his incline towards kindness instead of malice; they are some rare qualities that made him so precious. Sarai; with her understanding and her dream to belong in a world full of hatred and prejudice was also endearing. Every single character was portrayed in various shades; a blend of self-loathing; hatred; ambition; redemption and love coated them; leading them to horrible things and great acts of courage.
âI think youâ€™re a fairy tale. I think youâ€™re magical; and brave; and exquisite. And I hope you'll let me be in your story.âž
Strange the Dreamer was a remedy for the soul; it inflicted wounds; painful and devastating wounds; but it did so in a delicate manner. You only have to discover it yourselves!

He was richer now.
Now he had books.
Those of you whoâ€™ve been following my reviews and rant-views for a while; already know that my first experience with Laini Taylor and her Daughter of.. was a complete failure.
I kind of enjoyed the writing; even if I found it a little pompous and confusing; and the plot was not bad either; but my main problems were the characters and their interactions.
I couldnâ€™t be happier to admit that Strange the Dreamer made me change my mind and it did it in a way such that Iâ€™ll probably never stop thinking about this book.
I loved everything about this book.
The characters are all so amazing and well-crafted; even the evil ones.
Lazlo is simply adorable and incredibly relatable. I think his passion for everything bookish is admirable and something that we all can identify with; especially us Goodreads people.
I felt a deep connection with both him and Sarai; and their love is so pure and sweet that it makes you want to find your soulmate and fall in love for the rest of your life.
""Do you still think I'm a...a singularly unhorrible demon?""
""No;"" he said; smiling. ""I think you're a fairy tale. I think you're magical; and brave and exquisite. And..."" His voice grew bashful. Only in a dream could he be so bold and speak such words. ""I hope you'll let me be in your story.""
I also particularly liked Sparrow and Rubyâ€™s sisterly relationship; Calixte's witty bits; Shueyla's spirit and Eril-Fane and Azareen's mutual grief.
The setting is fantastic; it helps with the pace of the story and it creates the right dream-like atmosphere.
I think the problem with Laini Taylor and urban/modern settings; is that her imagination is so wild and big that; when it has to be contained or confined into a space and a story that follow determined rules; it loses half of its perfection.
So; yeah; the fact that Strange the Dreamer takes place in a world that the authorâ€™s created from the ground up; does nothing but add positive points to the final outcome.
Again; what I enjoyed the most was the writing.
Nothing beats the writing.
The author has a way with words that leaves you stunned; incredulously wondering how can someone even think of putting those simple words together and form coherent; unforgettable and striking lines like those ones.
Said this; I canâ€™t help but mention all those wonderful quotes *_________* theyâ€™ll definitely stay with me forever.
Its emptiness was stark. The room felt hollow and dead; like a body with its hearts cut out. Breathing wasn't easy.
He dropped onto the edge of his bed.
""They're only books;"" he told himself. Just paper and ink.
Paper; ink; and years.
Paper; ink; years; and dreams.
I adore Strange the Dreamer; it's the perfect story for those who aren't afraid to dream.
It also doesn't hurt that it was recommended to me by someone I admire and love very much. It makes this book twice as special.
The twists tho...

â€œYouâ€™re a storyteller. Dream up something wild and improbable;"" she pleaded. ""Something beautiful and full of monsters.""
â€œBeautiful and full of monsters?""
â€œAll the best stories are.â€
Overview: Second Read
Upping my rating to a full 5-Stars; because even though this book wasn't perfect it still made me ugly cry--sitting in my car right before the end of my lunch break.
This is a beautifully written story with a unique and engrossing world. Do yourself a favor and go in with as little info as possible. This slowly-builds; spending time developing the characters and the world. The writing is lavishly descriptive; inventive and every word feels perfectly chosen. Taylor straddles the line of purple prose in a few places; but manages to almost always land on the right side. Leaving us with a crystal-clear portrait of a truly magical setting.
If you're not a fan of slow-burn; this book probably isn't for you. The pacing is quite slow; but never aimless. The prologue establishes a destination and we spend the rest of the book getting there.
And this journey introduces us to some of the most likeable characters ever? Everyone is flawed; but Taylor so easily illustrates their hopes and dreams; that you can't help but root for them anyway. From Lazlo; the orphan boy who craves adventure; to Sarai; the girl struggling to reconcile her view of herself and humanity... everyone was interesting.
(Give me more male MCs who are introverted; not-gorgeous; and intelligent please????)
Also; my underrated fav?
- Thyon Nero
I swear I never hear anyone mention him; but I loved him. His actions in the beginning are frustrating; but he's still a sympathetic character? (and I would argue antihero?) The way he genuinely assumes ulterior motives for everyoneâ€™s actions broke my heart.
My only real problem with this book: the romance happens very fast. I understand why. I like the characters; and I think they are adorable together. But they don't even meet until 3/4s of the way through; and are very obsessed very quick. It's beautifully written and reminiscent of consuming first love but it's hard not to be annoyed when instead of discussing impending war they spend an entire chapter making out.
In Conclusion:
I've never read anything like this. The plot is amazingly creative and I love almost every character. One of my favorites--even if the kissing happens quickly. (less)",268,NEXTBOOK

http://s347.photobucket.com/user/emma...
This is one of the most beautiful and creative books I've ever read; and I needed to try to get some of its gorgeous imagery onto paper.
-----------------------------------
Strange the Dreamer is a beautiful story; but the word beautiful doesnâ€™t even seem to do it justice. It reads like a fairy tale and an ancient myth all swirled into one; and itâ€™s utterly unlike any book Iâ€™ve read in a long time. My heart is both full and broken; and Iâ€™m left with no idea of where to even begin this review.
Do you remember what it was like to read fairy tales as a kid; how it felt to uncover that world of wonder and awe and excitement you could find between the pages of a book? (Iâ€™m assuming most of your childhoods were as bookish and full of stories as mine was.) Do you know how feels to sit by a fire at night; listening to the sound of legends and adventures and ghost stories taking shape in that circle of flickering darkness? This book is all of those feelings and so much more. Itâ€™s the kind of story that feels both new and old at the same time: heartwarmingly nostalgic and impossibly inventive.
This is not a book to be read in one sitting. This book is like a large mug of cinnamon apple cider on a crisp fall day; like honey drizzling over the most delicious dessert you've ever tasted. Like something you can't help but savor because you don't know when you'll next come across something quite so exquisite.
One of the only other books that I can remember leaving me feeling this way is The Night Circusâ€”another favorite; and one that I highly recommend if you enjoyed this. Both Taylorâ€™s and Morgensternâ€™s writing styles are so incredibly atmospheric; bursting with such beauty and darkness.
The only way I feel I can properly sum it up is this: reading this book feels like magic.
There is so much cool shit in this book; allow me to list just a few things:
candy made out of blood
a boy who steals rain
imaginary cities where people leave free cakes on windows
a goddess who screams nightmares
a nerdy librarian MC
Speaking of said nerdy librarian MCâ€¦.allow me to introduce you to the new love of your life; Lazlo Strange. I honestly don't think I've ever read a book with a character who was so astoundingly good and yet still incredibly compelling and relatable. This is a boy who has spent his life dreaming of lost cities and accidentally getting his nose broken by falling books; who has grown up with neither love nor friendship and yet manages to be so tirelessly and effortlessly kind.
Sarai; the other main character; is more morally ambiguous; and makes for an interesting contrast to Lazlo. This is a spoiler-free review so I wonâ€™t go into more detail; but I loved her gradual introduction and the mysterious feel to her chapters as we learned her full story. Thereâ€™s so much goodness in her as well; even though the circumstances sheâ€™s lived in have done their best to turn her into a monster.
Now; Iâ€™m usually pretty much allergic to instalove......but for once it didn't bother me at all???? I think what I liked about the relationship in this book was that although the characters were drawn to each other from their first meeting; it was more of an emotional bond than one of those ""omg you're hot and I wanna rip your clothes off"" scenes that most romance plots begin with. I loved that Lazlo and Sarai were just so open and understanding with each other; and my heart ached for these two people who have always had so much love to give but who never got the chance.
The plot moves slowly; which is actually one of my favorite things about this book. It unravels the mysteries of Weep in such mysterious and fascinating ways; lingering on all of the beautiful and terrible details of its dark history and the characters who get caught up in trying to save it. I took me more than a week to finish this; I was stretching it out simply because I did not want it to end.
One of the most powerful parts of this story was how it deals with hate; and how such a strong feeling can gradually become so deeply and tragically rooted in a societyâ€™s collective consciousness. Lazlo wants to see the good in everything; but meeting Sarai forces him to confront the fact that so many of the people he admires have bitter prejudices carved into their hearts; and have committed unspeakable acts of violence in the name of peace. This complexity is the reason why despite all of the mysterious; magical elements; this story still feels heartbreakingly real and grounded. Terrible things have happened in Weep; atrocities have been carried out by both of the sides involved; and it is not easy to untangle good from evil. (Iâ€™m a sucker for anything with good moral gray areas; and this book did not disappoint.) Sarai; the Godslayer; and even Minya were especially fascinating characters in that regard.
The only thing I didnâ€™t particularly care for in this book was all the drama that went on with Ruby and Feral and Sparrow. I just didnâ€™t care enough about them to take much of an interest in those chapters. None of those three ever seemed relevant to anything that was happening; and it kinda felt like they were just there to fill space. The only godspawn I cared about were Sarai (because I love her; obviously) and Minya (because she is one fascinatingly Fucked Upâ„¢ evil six-year-old).
Alsoâ€”side note that is entirely unrelated to my enjoyment of the book itself: how is the US cover so ugly and the UK cover so fucking gorgeous?????? I feel cheatedâ€¦.. (@ all my friends in the UK will someone buy and mail me a copy please and thank you)
Anyway; if you havenâ€™t read this yet idk what youâ€™re doing with your life; but you should drop whatever it is now and acquaint yourselves with the glorious human specimen that is Lazlo Strange and the (literal) goddess that is Sarai and also the evil little fuck that is Minya. This book was everything I wanted and sososo much more. I donâ€™t think anything I can say can really do it justice; so just go read it.
Favorite quotes (Iâ€™m sorry there are so many but I couldnâ€™t choose; everything is gorgeous from page one. Also; these may be mildly spoiler-y so read at your own risk):
He was thinking of war; and the people the last one stole from him before he could know them; and all the children the next one would orphan and all the names that would die like songs.
Without his books; his room felt like a body with its hearts cut out.
Here; captured between covers; was the history of the human imagination; and nothing had ever been more beautiful; or fearsome; or bizarre. Here were spells and curses and myths and legends; and Strange the dreamer had for so long fed his mind on them that if one could wander into it they would discover a fantasia.
It was his mannerâ€”the warmth of him; like steam rising from tea.
""Beautiful and full of monsters?""
""All the best stories are.""
Vengeance ought to be spoken through gritted teeth; spittle flying; the cords of oneâ€™s soul so entangled in it that you canâ€™t let it go; even if you try. If you feel itâ€”if you really feel itâ€”then you speak it like itâ€™s a still-beating heart clenched in your fist and thereâ€™s blood running down your arm; dripping off your elbow; and you canâ€™t let go.
It danced over her senses the way the dream sun danced over the domes. Every color was deeper; richer than the real; and there were so many of them. If the weaver of the world itself had kept the chipped ends of every thread sheâ€™d ever used; her basket might look something like this. There were awnings over market stalls; and rows of spice shaped into cones. Rose and russet; scarlet and sienna. Old men blew colored smoke through long painted flutes; etching the air with soundless music.
Her lips were still moving; carrying the same words over and over. â€œThey were all I could carry. They were all I could carry.â€
There was no echo; no reverberation. If anything; the room ate sound. It swallowed her voice; her words; and her eternal; inadequate apology. But not her memories.
She would never be rid of those.
â€œThey were all I could carry.â€
It was as though sheâ€™d slipped behind a curtain in his mind and the moment he saw the mural; the curtain fell and she was there: the girl with skin the color of the sky; who had stood so close; studying him as though he were a painting.
â€œAnd it was love;â€ she went on; and she put that into her voice; too; as well as she was able. Love that sets forth the soul like springtime and ripens it like summer. Love as rarely exists in reality; as if a master alchemist has taken it and distilled out all the impurities; every petty disenchantment; every unworthy thought; into a perfect elixir; sweet and deep and all-consuming. â€œHe loved her so much;â€ she whispered. â€œIt was all a lie.â€
â€œI think youâ€™re a fairy tale. I think youâ€™re magical; and brave; and exquisite. Andâ€¦â€ His voice grew bashful. Only in a dream could he be so bold and speak such words. â€œI hope youâ€™ll let me be in your story.â€
The unconscious mind is open terrainâ€”no walls or barriers; for better or worse. Thoughts and feelings are free to wander; like characters leaving their book to taste life in other stories. Terrors roam; and so do yearnings. Secrets are turned out like pockets; and old memories meet new. They dance and leave their scents on each other; like perfume transferred between lovers.
Lazlo did not want to die. The desire to not die had never been so piercing. It was like hearing a song so beautiful that you understood not only the meaning of art; but life. It gutted him; and buoyed him; ripped out his hearts and gave them back bigger.
â€œI turned my nightmares into fireflies and caught them in a jar.â€

About a month ago I was recording a podcast with the lovely Anne Bogel and one of the recommendations she gave me was to read Beartown. While we all know Backman for his uplifting fiction that is both touching and emotional; this was described to me as ""a serious; heavy read that lacked his whimsical trademark"". There are few things I love more than reading a book that is wholly different than what an author is known for; so I knew I had to pick this one up quickly and see what all the fuss was about. When Sam from Clues and Reviews suggested a buddy read I knew that time had come (SPOILER ALERT-SHE LOVED IT TOO). I'm so glad that I picked this up when I did; I'm currently in major book hangover mode and can't seem to settle in with another story until I work through my feelings on this one. Bare with me as this review will be long winded.
""It's only a game. It only resolves tiny; insignificant things. Such as who gets validation. Who gets listened to. It allocates power and draws boundaries and turns some people into stars and others into spectators. That's all.""
Hockey has never been my thing. I grew up in the deep south where football is praised more highly than any other sport; but baseball was where my friends and I found ourselves watching games in high school. Most of my guy friends were on the team; and I remember the awe inspiring excitement we felt at every win and the crushing agony of each loss. I attended a small private school that wasn't known for it's ability to crush it's opponents in sports; but during my high school years we had an exceptionally good baseball team (2 of our players ended up playing professionally years later). It was difficult for our school to get behind the idea of team spirit and to fan the flame of hope when we were crushed in each game season after season; but I remember the anticipation that began to grow amongst the student body those years. This experience is what allowed me to fully succumb to the excitement of the hockey scenes in this story. Hockey is a large piece of this book and I'd go as far as suggesting that hockey is it's own character in the novel; but it wasn't from an overly technical point of view. I found that the overall plot and the hockey scenes awoke that same feeling I used to have while watching high school baseball and it brought to life a sport I never dreamed I could become entranced by. I think Backman said it best when he wrote ""Hockey is like faith. Religion is something between you and other people; it's full of interpretations and theories and opinions. But faith... that's just between you and God. It's what you feel in your chest when the referee glides out to the center circle between two players; when you hear the sticks strike each other and see the black disk fall between them. Then it's just between you and hockey. Because cherry trees always smell of cherry trees; whereas money smells of nothing.""
""A great deal is expected of anyone who's been given a lot.""
This seems to be the central theme surrounding the book. There are a great deal of characters in this novel; the ever-changing and growing cast seems to add multidimensional aspects to the story that cause it to leap off the page and bury deep into your mind. There were certain characters and views that I was naturally more drawn to (i.e. Amat; Benji; and Kira); yet I found each tongue necessary in the overall narrative to give the clearest picture; this also caused myself to question my knee-jerk reactions and judgements I dropped along the way. In an attempt to not spoil anything for future readers; I'll just state that the content is heavy and much darker than a traditional Backman story; but it still holds that magical quality where you seem to be watching the exchanges and thoughts happening from just outside the realm of reason. There is nothing in this tale that hasn't been written before; but the way in which it is told was especially unique and the subject matter is timely and necessary.
""If you are honest; people may deceive you. Be honest anyway.
If you are kind; people may accuse you of selfishness. Be kind anyway.
All the good you do today will be forgotten by others tomorrow.
Do good anyway.""
The above is just a fraction of the wisdom handed down from Amat's mother; and I highly recommend picking up a copy just to read the rest; but my purpose for posting above is to clarify how this sums up the moral of the story. Even with all the injustice surrounding the evil act committed in this novel; there are consistently small glimmers of hope. Please do not misunderstand; this is not a happy go lucky book. There are no feel good finishing pages; although there is still that seed of sunlight planted. What I found separated this from being just another depressing story was the shining examples of forgiveness. There are many examples of diversity on all ends of the spectrum included in this story as well; and the author has woven them through in such a way where it doesn't feel forced or awkward; there is nothing screaming ""Look at me! Look at how diverse my characters are! Please pat me on the back for simply including them!"" No; these characters were infused with a subtle realism that caused me to take a step back after turning the final page and bask in the awe I felt from what Backman created with this book. While I could ramble on for days; I'd rather stop here and highly suggest that you pick up your own copy and experience first hand the sheer brilliance of Beartown. This book wrecked me; it pulverized my soul and made me realize how easy it would be for this story to come to life. Highly; HIGHLY recommended for anyone willing to give this novel a fair shot. I'm not sure this story; nor these characters; will ever fully leave my consciousness; and I simply cannot wait to experience whatever Backman choses to craft next.

Oh my lord. If you need me; I'll be wallowing in a giant puddle of all my feelings and emotions. Someone hold me. I was planning on just doing a mini review on this one but I feel a long winded breakdown coming on this weekend. This will likely be one of my top reads of the year.

Every once in a while you stumble upon a book that takes you by surprise; becoming far more meaningful than you ever anticipated. 'Beartown' is precisely that type of book. Bravo; Mr. Backman!
When 'Beartown' first started showing up on so many of my friends' feeds; I was mildly curious. Not being a sports fan; by any stretch of the imagination; I filed it away in the back of my mind in the ""maybe one day"" category. Knowing only that it centered on a junior hockey team in a small town; I had envisioned something akin to 'The Mighty Ducks' played out on paper.
However; as the 5-star reviews kept rolling in; I grew increasingly interested. I had to see what all the buzz was about. After all; there's no way that 'The Mighty Ducks' would stir up that type of a response.
So; I downloaded the Audible version and bumped it to the top of my audiobook TBR list. It proved to be the best decision I could have made. This book was phenomenal!
'Beartown' started a little slow for me. With so many characters; it was hard to keep everyone straight at first. Yet; it crept up on me slowly. Before I knew it; I was completely engrossed in the lives of these characters and the small town dynamics.
I couldn't pull myself away from it. 'Beartown' is the type of book that tempts you to play sick and call-in to work so that you can keep reading/listening. I became completely engrossed in this story as it unfolded.
Beartown is like many small towns across the globe. The decline of industry and tourism has wreaked havoc on this small town's economy. Only in Beartown; the hopes and dreams of an entire community are pinned on the success of a junior hockey team.
These teen boys are treated like celebrities and the weight of the world is on their shoulders. Parents; business sponsors; booster club members and a variety of other individuals all contribute to this high-pressure environment. Morality and justice take a back seat to winning. Nothing is more important than hockey.
With a robust cast of characters; the viewpoints offered in 'Beartown' are diverse. The relationships are rich and enlightening. Everything weaves together to make a complex web; with hockey at the center. Events are inter-connected and this book explores the ripple-effect of actions.
More than anything else; 'Beartown' forces readers to evaluate their values and take a look in the mirror. It tackles some very difficult content and serves as a reminder of the hazards of blind idolization. From peer pressure; to homophobia; to rape culture; to personal integrity; this book forces readers to take a candid look at problems that plague all societies.
This book was an emotional rollercoaster. At times; I felt inspired. Other times I was absolutely outraged. It made me feel joyful and also sad. You name it and I felt it at some point while listening to 'Beartown'. It was the type of book that moves you.
Without a doubt; I would recommend 'Beartown' to everyone. It is definitely one that has made it's mark on me; like only the best books do. The narration was also extremely well done and really made for a pleasurable listening experience.

But when you get really cold your blood-vessels contract and your heart does all it can to stop blood reaching the frozen parts of your body and then coming back to your heart cold.
Not unlike a hockey team suffering a penalty and playing at a numerical disadvantage:
prioritize resources; play defensively; defend the heart; lungs and brain. What happens when the defense finally collapses; when you get cold enough; is that your box play falls apart; your goalie does something stupid; your backs stop communicating with each other; and the body parts that were previously shut off from circulation are suddenly switched back on again. And then; when warm blood from your heart flows back to your frozen feet and hands; you experience an intense rush of heat. That's why you suddenly imagine that you're overheating and start to take your clothes off.
Then the chilled blood goes back to your heart and it's all over. Every couple of years or so; someone in Beartown goes home drunk after a party and takes a shortcut across the ice; or gets lost in the forest; or sits down to rest for a moment; and is found lifeless in a snowdrift the following morning"".
Hockey is more than just a game in the 'Beartown'....it's the focus of the community's small town universe. Everyone is affected.....The game itself requires sacrifice -- long training sessions for the kids - Dedication from coaches; ( old school and new school thoughts of best way to train young kids) ; wives; children; and friends of the team are aware they live in HOCKEY TOWN.
-- The General manager works long hours --- even when he is home.
Hockey distraction pulls him away from the family.
The President of the club pulls weight and adds pressure.
The Board of directors and sponsors try to pull power ranks in hiring and firing.
Fanatical parents can get nasty; and competitive with other parents.
Teachers have a hard time demanding respect in their classroom from their students who are star athletes.
Educators are influenced by wealthy community members.
Store and bar owners contribute to the town at large.
Friends and family in the community are aware of the type of town they live in. It's very clear! Hockey is a family member in and of itself!!
There are personal & team struggles - on and off the ice:
Parties - alcohol- drugs- sex - rape - lies - cool kids - fat kids- lonely kids - rich and poor kids - kids trying to fit in - love - loss - lies - betrayal - secrets - death - financial strains- forgiveness; marriage and family issues - loneliness- friendships - jealousy - anger - loyalty - admiration- inspiring relationships- and not so inspiring.
There is the challenge of the economy of the town itself and the expectation- hopes and dreams that a junior hockey team might have to boast the towns economy.
Factory workers who have lost jobs may get re-hired. Tourism may increase. Beartown would be held in higher regard.
......For a player like Benji -- whose father committed suicide when he was little - hockey gave him a context; a structure; rules; and it rewarded him with the best sides of himself: his boundless heart and unshakeable loyalty. It provided a focus for his energy; channeling it into something constructive. All through his childhood he would sleep with his hockey stick beside him.
......Having buried a father and son within a year period; being the General Manager of the junior Hockey team gave Peter Andersson the feeling of keeping something alive. His wife Kira; a lawyer; who commuted to work just outside of Beartown; thought less of the over zealous hockey obsessive hockey community. She loved her husband but never really understood why the game made grown men a bag of nerves. Their daughter Maya; 15 years old; enjoyed playing her guitar. We will embrace her pain and feel her anger as her story develops. Her best friend Ana spent the night at her house almost every night. This friendship puzzled me for awhile as to why she never slept at her own house - but made sense as the story continued.
Leo; 12 years old; the son of the Andersson family shares his dad's passion for Hockey like most of the town. Easy going kid.
.......Star hockey player Kevin Erdahl; good grades; from a prominent family; had guys scrambling for best friend position- ( which was usually Benji); and girls throwing themselves at him. The only people that weren't 'pudding-at-his-feet' were his parents. Kevin's parents were the wealthy family in town - they financially sponsored the hockey team - high achievers- result oriented- but emotionally distant. Kevin may have had the most natural talent on the team - but he had other handicaps.
David and Sune - both hockey coaches argued about whether a 17-year-old could be ready to play in the A-team. Sune-- the older coach lived by the traditional team motto for years...since the beginning of the club: .....""Culture; Values; Community"". The worn old banner hung in the locker room.
David; the younger coach knew he could never really properly explain; that the true drive for a star player like Kevin had nothing to do with values - culture or community....but......
""his absolute desire to win. Not that he hates losing; but that he can't even begin to conceive of trying to accept not winning. He's merciless. You can't teach that.""
David believed ""hockey has always been that the world outside the rink mustn't
encroach upon the world inside it. They need to be separate universes. Outside; real life is complicated and frightening and hard; but inside the rink it is straightforward and comprehensible. If David hadn't kept the world so clearly divided; these guys; with all the shit they've had to deal with out in the real world; would've been broken even as little kids. But the rink was a refuge. Their one happy place"".
Amat; the youngest player - the fastest; who played with heart; stepped up a level; lived with his single mother. He's the guy who would naturally gather up pucks and cones after practice. Not because anyone told him to because it gave him a chance to avoid others. When it came to talking about girls; parties; or boasting about snorts-of-coke or blowjobs; Amat was reluctant to join in the laughter..... yet that overwhelming feeling of being allowed to belong was something he wanted too. The warm feeling to 'belong' was a strong attraction.
As you can see - many themes get covered. Each of the characters are so well developed- I feel like I know them - as people. I know this town. The strengths - weakness - the sadness - the sport!
For many years my next door neighbor played for The San Jose Sharks.
His wife and and 5 kids too. Ice Hockey is a popular sport in San Jose because of the Sharks. Our younger daughter was a huge fan -knowing every team members name - and many team members. - so from the basic beauty of the sport - including the tunnel vision quest for competitive excellence; scores; statistics; and victories....I enjoyed the subject- vehicle - in which Fredrik Backman told this story.
I felt that Backman brought a remarkable voice to the world of 'training-dedication'. . be it Hockey; dance; music; or martial arts.......competitor or simply an enthusiast. This book is compulsively intimate providing different perspectives - different stories illuminating the benefits of any skill training - the challenges- for all those who are involved.... ""Bear Town"" in this case!
THE BEST PART: Deeply EMOTIONALLY FELT!!! 'DEEPLY'!!! You can read a thousand reviews- NONE OF THEM WILL BE SPOILERS- ( enjoy them all); because this novel is an 'experience-on-steroids'.
MUST BE EXPERIENCED yourself! -- gorgeous insightful prose!!

So despite people's warm feelings about Backman's next two books; I passed; because I have enough to worry about becoming a (hopefully) charming curmudgeon someday soon. However; I did pounce on his novella And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer ; and I fell in love with it (curmudgeon-ish character and all); and it easily found its way onto my list of the best books I read last year.
Even with full confidence in Backman's storytelling ability; I was surprised to learn his newest book; Beartown ; didn't follow the same pattern of his other books; but rather focused on a small town which many think is dying out; a town literally obsessed with hockey. I wondered how this would work. But then as I read this book over the course of one late evening in the throes of insomnia; I was blown away; because this was so much more than a hockey novel. Backman pulled off a colossal feat; a literary mic drop.
Beartown is a small forest town that seems to be getting subsumed by the trees around it. One of the few highlights of Beartown is an old hockey rink which was for many years home to the only pastime enjoyed by the factory workers who lived there and the townspeople who cheered with and jeered at them.
""Sometimes the entire community feels like a philosophical experiment: If a town falls in the forest but no one hears it; does it matter at all?""
But even for a hockey-obsessed town; the excitement is becoming nearly too much to bear. Beartown's junior ice hockey team is about to compete in the national semifinals; and many in town think they're going to win. The team may be good; but their star player; Kevin; is exceptional; and thanks to his best friend and defender (both on the rink and off); Benji; he's even better. The outcome of the game has the potential to change many livesâ€”the players; including a new player brought on to the team unexpectedly; the general manager; once a hometown hero who briefly dallied in the NFL; several of the club's coaches; who have differing ideas about what coaches are supposed to do; even town leaders; who see the bright horizon a win could bring.
Despite what happens in that game; one night everything changes. An incident; an accusation; cause sides to be taken; lines to be drawn; people to show their true colors; friendships to strengthen and/or wither. Suddenly Beartown isn't sure what it is or should beâ€”should hockey and its players come first? Is that all that matters? Do the haves get; while the have-nots suffer?
Backman has written an outstanding; emotional; thought-provoking novel about so much more than a town and a game. It's a book about the responsibilities and burdens of parenthood and the ripple effects missteps in parenting can cause; it's a book about belonging; about finally feeling a part of something when you've spent so much time on the outside looking in; it's a book about the staggering powerâ€”positive and negativeâ€”of friendship; and it's a book about the toll keeping secrets can have on you.
It's funny; I was thinking I would get a Swedish Friday Night Lights but instead found so much more. Backman once again proves he is a writer to be reckoned with; and I'll let him lead me wherever he wants to go next time. No questions asked.
NetGalley and Atria Books provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review. Thanks for making this available!

Fredrik Backman is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. His characters and storytelling are practically perfect. I can easily recommend this book to anyone.
There are so many different facets to this book. Questions of morality and loyalty; passion over logic; and right vs wrong. No path through the story is easy and no solution obvious. The background story of every character is perfectly developed and important in the fine tapestry the Backman weaves. You may be surprised to discover that a story about a little hockey town far away can make you think about how you approach life in general.
One final bit of awesomeness about this book. With some books you may reach the end having found one or two really great quotes. Well; when you read this; be prepared with a highlighter; page flags; etc. as almost every page has a fantastic quote that is worth remembering after the story is done.
Honestly; truthfully; literally . . . Backman is good; REALLY good! (less)",275,NEXTBOOK

Although the book had a bit of a difficult start for me; it developed into an emotionally-charged hot bed; triggering anger and frustration over so many things about the human race... and I'm quite glad I read it and enjoyed it. But wow... I haven't a visceral emotional reaction to words like this in a very long time.
Why This Book
Beartown began showing up on a few of my Goodreads' friends booklists earlier this year; intriguing my interest. I read the overview and saw many comments that ""although the premise of all about a junior hockey team; it's so much more."" I had a hard time believing that to be true but thought it might be worth a chance if I could get it from NetGalley. And then I was approved to read it in early April. It took me a few weeks to find the right time in my reading schedule; but it all fell into place last week when I finally took the book on. Also of note: itâ€™s translated from Swedish.
Overview of Story
Beartown is a very small town in the middle of a forest far away from everywhere else. It was once bigger and stronger; but the economy has pushed it further and further down a hole -- to the point where all they have left is the possibility of a good junior hockey team in the future. Everyone in the town gets involved to some degree; either playing; supporting or raising the players who range from 13 to 17 years old. It's the place where agents sometimes go to find the next great star of the professional leagues.
But the lack of resources and funding has led to a bitter passion among the residents; who seem to stop at almost nothing to ensure their kids have an opportunity to win their games. Some of the residents are fair and honest. Some are rude and malicious. It feels like a typical American sports town; (but the story is set in Sweden) breeding team camaraderie fueled in some cases by hatred and anger; but in a few; promoting acceptance and tolerance.
Each of the key team members (8 to 10) has a personal story. Each of the parents and coaches have a vision. Rivalries and favoritism shine all around. And with each passing game; the school decided what side of the coin they're on... supporting the team and accepting hockey will always comes first; before education; or fighting back to keep a fair balance. But when someone is attacked; sides must be taken within the school; the team; the hockey league and the town.
It's a story about hope; control; loss; jealousy; anger; and desire. It's about parenting styles. It's about looking the other way for the sake of long-term goals despite what you may be letting someone get away with in the short term. It's about how people treat one another. And in so many cases; it is not the way it should be.
Approach & Style
Beartown is told by an omniscient narrator who can look into any characters head at any moment.
It's told in the present tense with a few small reflections on the past.
Point of view changes and hops around within chapters; defined by a few spaces between paragraphs.
It's mostly short sentence structure and paragraphs. Told the way people speak.
Strengths
1. I am not a big sports fan. I played on a soccer and baseball team when I was younger. And I worked for a sports arena for nearly 20 years. But I have never been interested in hockey. And while the story is too focused in the beginning on the pertinent parts of the sport and rules; it generally has a very good approach to building a fever for the team among us readers. When an author can do that; it's a strong book.
2. The characters are fairly vivid; each representing a difference slice of life and personality. You will like a few. You will hate many of them. It's another good thing when an author can deliver this level of emotion. As an example; Maggan Lyt supports her son no matter what he has done. And she's rude to everyone; lies; believes her own lies and has no sense of morality. She wasn't a huge part of the story; but she is the epitome of what I hate about what sports can do to a kid. She's the worst kind of mother and should have been taught a bigger lesson. (I rarely go off on topics; especially like this... but she is what is wrong with so many things right now about how people behave in this world...)
3. The setting is described nearly perfectly. You feel the despair. You see the emptiness. You can tell it's a freezing cold pit of fear.
4. Views are told from everyone's angle. And even though you will have pure hatred for some of the people; part of you has a small understanding of why they do what they do. You won't accept it or like it; but you can see how it happened in Beartown. And you will wonder if that's what's happening in so many other towns across the country.
Open Questions & Concerns
During the first 60 to 75 pages; I was a little frustrated at the focus on hockey as a sport the town rallied around. It was slightly boring and difficult to connect. I trudged through; reading 75 pages the first night and the second night. By the third night (last night). I was 35% through and starting to feel that intense sensation where you just don't want to put the book down; and I finished the last 300 pages all in one sitting (in bed). Intense because I was so angry at the people; the actions and their beliefs. It made me feel sorrow for any town who focuses on sports as the center of their life. I've always thought high school sporting teams were full of nonsense. I don't want to alienate any readers of the book or even my reviews... but I really have to ask the question... Do school sports breed teamwork or do they breed arrogance and nasty habits of accepting things just because you're on the same team? I'm sure there are good examples of a team building positive traits in children... but this was not one of them. When they're proud to have injuries... when they support someone who has clearly done something bad because they are on the same team... when they use derogatory language in a locker room because it helps create a bond... that's not teamwork. That's humanity at its worst... that's people thinking they are above others because they have some physical talent for playing a sport. I have little if any tolerance or patience for people like that. Even when I played on teams; sure; I bought into the ""rah; rah; let's win"" concept. But the second it crosses that line and because a situation where it's just bad behavior or the thoughts of the uninformed and lazy; ridiculous politics of small minds; I wish they'd all go straight to hell in a hand-basket. And that's how this book made me feel - it conjured up those feelings.... and it was really well done. It hit all the hot spots I have about awful sports parents; horrible team members who think they can do anything because they're a ""hero.""
I couldn't push this up to a perfect 5 for a few reasons; but it's very close!
1. Some of the characters felt too similar / duplicate. I had a bit of a hard time distinguishing them from one another; e.g. which parent is that; what happened to that kid before the game? It could have been a little tighter in this area.
2. I'm a bit unclear on the ending... it was like there were 2 possible versions... and I wanted to know exactly what happened. It also didn't feel like every character had a proper ending... a few open issues left for me.
Author & Other Similar Books
I haven't read any other sports-themed books; so I don't have anything to compare it to from that perspective. But as far as the intensity of your anger or hatred for some of the characters... I would liken it to how I felt about James K. Morrow's The Philosopher's Apprentice.
Final Thoughts
I've ranted a bit here. It's a powerful book. It showcases many of the fears I have about a good portion of the country. I'm all for team spirit and finding hope in an activity when there seems to be nothing else available; however; if this is a commentary on what it's like for many towns across the world... my fears are justified. And when a book can share and show that... it's a really strong one... and worth the read.
P.S. No offense intended to anyone who is a big sports fan; sports parents or sports player themselves. The anger I felt in reading this book is for the negativity steaming off all the wrong things about sports and how they make people act. I'm all for a positive; character-building team sport where the intensity is on the field... and the only thing left off the field is friendship; fair and honest support and an ability to know when to draw the line.

Not always; although more in the last year; I buy over hyped books. They are not always as good as they seem. But I decided to give a try to Beartown and oh; blew me away.
I am not someone outside sports and I understand the sacrifices that have to be made to achieve goals. When I was a teenager I practiced swimming. We had a national preselection competition. I got the flu and I kept swimming even with fever; because that was demanded from me. I ended up with bronchopneumonia and I had to stop swimming for life. Actions and consequences.
This book catches you from the start. You don't know how it will end up in the first page prediction. It could literally be anyone. The story is full of teenagers.
Beartown is a city with subzero temperatures most of the year; in decay; businesses closing and many layoffs. Its people speak little and are well delimited according to their social position. The higher you live; the better your income.
The people have their hopes set on the junior hockey team. If they win; they expected investments will be made in the town and it will be a better place.
But even if Beartown only talks about hockey; the book is much more. Do not expect lessons; or complicated language. It's more about people and players. It is about the President of the hockey club that must accept demands from the sponsors to continue sponsoring; about the General Manager who must fire his mentor so that they can appoint another person; on the hockey star and excellent student; but his parents are always absent; about his best friend without whom he can't play but who keeps a great secret; about the owner of the bar that has not left the premises since her husband died eleven years ago; about how a Family survives when one of the children dies; about how the town faces a horrible crime that will affect hockey; and much; much more.
There are many characters and each one of them is important. No one is named to name it. You know who they are and how they think. This is one of the best features of the book. It's close. In more than one opportunity it will leave you feeling more of an emotion.
Undoubtedly it is one of the best books I've ever read.

No siempre; aunque mÃ¡s en el Ãºltimo aÃo; compro los libros que tienen mucha publicidad. No siempre son tan buenos como parecen. Pero a Beartown decidÃ­ darle una oportunidad y oh; como me impactÃ³.
No soy alguien ajena a los deportes y entiendo los sacrificios que hay que hacer para lograr metas. Cuando era adolescente practicaba nataciÃ³n. TenÃ­amos una competencia de preselecciÃ³n nacional. Me dio gripe y seguÃ­ nadando inclusive con fiebre porque eso se me exigÃ­a. Al final me dio bronconeumonÃ­a y tuve que dejar la nataciÃ³n de por vida. Acciones y consecuencias.
Este libro te atrapa desde el inicio. No sabes cÃ³mo terminarÃ¡ en la predicciÃ³n de la primera pÃ¡gina. Literalmente podrÃ­a ser cualquiera. La historia estÃ¡ llena de adolescentes.
Beartown es una ciudad con temperaturas bajo cero la mayor parte del aÃo; en decadencia; negocios cerrando y muchos despidos. Su gente habla poco y estÃ¡n bien delimitados segÃºn su posiciÃ³n social. Mientras mÃ¡s arriba vivas significarÃ¡ mejores ingresos.
El pueblo tiene sus esperanzas puestas en el equipo Junior de hockey. Si ellos ganan se espera que se hagan inversiones en el pueblo y pueda prosperar.
Pero aunque en Beartown solo se habla de hockey; el libro es mucho mÃ¡s. No esperen lecciones; ni lenguaje complicado. Es mÃ¡s sobre las personas y los jugadores. Es sobre el Presidente del club de hockey que debe aceptar exigencias de los patrocinadores para que sigan patrocinando; sobre el General Manager que debe despedir a su mentor para que puedan nombrar en su puesto a otra persona; sobre la estrella del hockey y excelente estudiante; pero que sus padres siempre estÃ¡n ausentes; sobre su mejor amigo sin el que no puede jugar pero que guarda un gran secreto; sobre la dueÃa del bar que no ha salido del local desde que se muriÃ³ su esposo hace once aÃos; sobre cÃ³mo sobrevive una familia cuando se muere uno de los hijos; sobre cÃ³mo enfrenta el pueblo un hecho descabellado que afectarÃ¡ al hockey; y mucho; mucho mÃ¡s.
Hay muchos personajes y cada uno de ellos es importante. No se nombra a alguien por nombrarlo. Conoces quiÃ©n es cada quien y cÃ³mo piensa. Esta es una de las mejores caracterÃ­sticas del libro. Es cercano. En mÃ¡s de una oportunidad te dejarÃ¡ sintiendo mÃ¡s de una emociÃ³n.
Sin lugar a dudas es uno de los mejores libros que he leÃ­do. (less)",277,NEXTBOOK

Fredrik Backman: Youâ€™ve left me drained; almost completely bereft of words. This is a novel; unlike any of your others; yet itâ€™s so full of heart and emotion that we the readers know emphatically that it is yours. And after the last words have sunk into my soul; I can emphatically say; thank you! This one is to be treasured.
Now; what can I possibly say about this story; without giving it away?
Beartown is a town that eat; sleeps and goes to bed thinking about one thing: Hockey. Hockey is what makes this town tick. Vibrate. Come Alive. Beartown; and its residents wouldnâ€™t be a community without it. Every person; every family pins their hearts on the Junior Boyâ€™s Hockey team and its inhabitants have nothing left. Itâ€™s a huge cross for these kids to bear (no pun intended) and sometimes; well; something or someone has to break. Sadly; strength and resilience give way to anger and pain; leaving no stone unturned; yet that little bear inside those who've been dealt the most blows; refuses to give up.
Whether or not you like Hockey; I can almost assure you that it will grow on you after reading this. And if you know someone who plays? Well; you will understand the drive and the desire better than a lot of us. But the raw human emotion that is dripping from each and every page of this novel? You will all feel that. Fredrik Backman evokes it from each and every reader and here; he does so in a way that he has never done before. And I am truly honored and extremely grateful to have experienced it.
A huge thank you to NetGalley; Atria Books and the amazing Fredrik Backman for giving me this ARC in exchange for an honest review. It has been a privilege.

What did I care about hockey? I didn't. But the novel soon becomes about more than just the sport; about so much more than I can articulate in a review without giving too much away; but I'll try. Backman tells us early on what I was about to discover for myself.
""Why does anyone care about hockey?
...
Because it tells stories. ""
Beartown is a small Swedish town in a forest that could be a small town anywhere. Maybe the sport in these towns is baseball or soccer or football. But here it is hockey. In spite of the universality of it; there is a sense of place so striking that it's like another character. This is the story of many of the town's residents - the kids; their families and how they are connected by the game; but the connections are more than just the game . There are alternating chapters; sometimes just alternating paragraphs about them; with new characters continually introduced. Somehow the continuity is never lost; someone is always linked to someone else. The narrative moves from character to character; family to family providing such an in depth picture of who they are. It takes an amazingly talented writer to do this with so many characters to keep tract of. The writing sometimes feels subtle but yet I came to intimately know these characters as I did in his other novels.
Young hockey players; coaches who are former hockey players; their spouses; mothers and fathers. It seems that just about everyone carries a burden. Some are grieving; some are lonely; some are bullied; some carry secrets; yet a few summon the strength to move forward. My favorite characters are Maya; who in the face of being victimized provides the strength and love that holds her family together and of course Ramona who lifts herself out of her grief to save the town from itself. I can't forget about Amat who wants to fit in; save his mother but faces the challenge of doing what is right and Ana the best friend that anyone could ever hope for. Backman has woven a complex story full of sadness; hope; discovery; people fighting their own demons; about parents and kids. Not all the games are won but there are triumphs of friendship; love; and doing what is right. To Fredrik Backman ; I say from the heart tack sa mycket for another beautiful story.

This is the story of how we got there.
At first I wasn't really getting into this book. I don't know why because:
1) I love the author
2) I love hockey
3) I love coming of age stories
4) I love the cold
5) I love small towns. I was born in one.
It finally got to where I liked it enough to change stars from 3 to 4. Although; I really wish for a better ending. Don't get me wrong; it was a great ending. . . I just wanted....... something else to happen. Uggg; I can't say because you will know. Let me just say I wouldn't haven't walked away and maybe those that have read it will know what I'm talking about.
This whole little community of Beartown is nothing but hockey baby.
And a lot of these boys are pretty bad @ssed on the ice! I mean they are going somewhere; maybe not where they want to go.
There are a lot of characters in the story. Some I hated more than life (one in particular) and others I liked. I can't keep them all straight and I didn't write them all down. Damn.
Benji
Kevin
Amat
Maya
etc and so on.
these kids are all different ages and of course everyone in the town knows each other. A lot of them have been there since the ice age. And there is nothing wrong with that.
It's not just about hockey; although most of it is; but it's about them growing up with hockey; how they feel. There are adults that having issues. There is a terrible attack in the town that throws everyone out of kilter. To me that was simple; red hot poker people; red hot poker.
To me; I think this would have been a nice place to live if it wasn't one of those places where the sport is more important than a human life so to speak. I can't say more. Otherwise; the close knit community is a great thing.
I wish I could have loved it to death like everyone else on the face of the planet but I thought it was good enough.

Holy cow! I never expected to love this book. I'm not a sports person let alone a hockey person. Thanks to my Goodreads friends I took a chance on it. I'm so glad I did! 5 Stars for Beartown! This book grabbed me from the very beginning and never let go. Bang bang bang is still in my head!
Beartown is about a declining small town in Sweden that revolves around it's hockey team. There are so many characters in this book; including current hockey players and former players. The fate of this town revolves around hockey.
I would love to see this made into a movie. I could see Meryl Streep playing Ramona. I loved her! I'd like to see Tom Hiddleston as David. I could keep casting but you will just get a list of my favorite actors! Lol!
Props to the narrator; Marin Ireland! She was awesome! I wouldn't recommend this as a first listen only because there are so many different characters in the story but otherwise I highly recommend the audio!
This is my first Fredrik Backman book but it will definitely not be my last!

Welcome to the poor side of town. BEARTOWN is way out yonder in the middle of a forest where winter temperatures reach sub-zero and hockey is the name of the game for its struggling residents.
You don't have to be a hockey fan; or sports fan for that matter; to read BEARTOWN; you only have to (once again) sit back and enjoy the superb and addictive story telling of Fredrik Backman.
So get ready.....there's a whole gang of characters who each have their own personal stories to tell.....some even have big secrets; and some do evil; but most importantly; many of them will demonstrate what it means to have a big heart; show courage in the face of danger; and even give up their dreams if it means survival for their small town.
I was surprised how my opinion of certain characters changed as the story developed; and although I have more than one favorite; Ramona is the one that will stick with me for a good while.....what a tough cookie!
Excellent Read! Highly Recommend!

I really really liked My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry. But when I read Backman's last full length novel -- Britt-Marie Was Here -- I wondered whether Backman was a one trick pony; the formula being to create a quirky difficult character and the people who come to love him/her because he/she has a good heart under that gruff exterior.
Well it turns out that Backman is no One Trick Pony; and he has a lot to write about besides quirky difficult characters. Beartown is nothing like Backman 's earlier novels. Beartown is a small town in Sweden obsessed with its junior hockey team. The novel focuses on an ensemble of disparate characters associated with the hockey team in different ways. Something nasty happens; and it shows the worst side of small communities and sports. The challenge with reviewing Beartown is that it's hard not to talk about what makes this book so interesting and powerful without giving away any spoilers. Suffice it to say that Beartown asks some big questions about small communities; families and friendship -- questions about the price of belonging and not belonging; the ugliness and beauty of loyalty; the lengths that parents will go to to protect their children from the herd; and many more. These questions are not explored at the expense of the characters or story. Backman's strength remains his ability to create characters; especially those who are outliers. And the end was brilliant.

Itâ€™s Edgy
Itâ€™s Awestricken
Itâ€™s Resolute
Itâ€™s Tragic
Itâ€™s Otherworldly
Itâ€™s Winning
Itâ€™s Nightmarish
In Beartown; one thing; and only one thing is important ... their hockey team. The players are obsessed! The parents are obsessed! The residents are obsessed! Lives revolve around hockey; and if you donâ€™t tow the line; there are plenty of buses to be thrown under. Only one result matters no matter what the cost; â€œWIN!!!â€
The town is unfortunately a depressed; forgotten; in the middle of no-whereâ€™s ville; dot on the map. The locals are hanging their hats and hopes on the junior hockey team winning the state championship and putting Beartown back on the map of prosperity.
Filled to the brim with characters essential to the success of the hockey program; the story is told in short segments; a look as you will into the lives of each individual. We get a glimpse into what they are thinking; feeling; hoping for; regretting. Each snippet is building and building up to a shocking event which will change everyone and everything! It will pit friend against friend; neighbor against neighbor; family member against family member.
Beartown will never be the same!
Fredrik Backman is a masterful storyteller. His writing style is atypical in this book; but I found it to be very effective and kept me on the edge of my seat.

I DID like this but didn't love it as many readers clearly did. Backman certainly has a gift for developing characters that feel real and for creating atmosphere; but I didn't love the narrative structure he uses here. He has a large cast of rotating characters and each character has a brief mini story arc that often (too often for me) concludes with the equivalent of a Jack Handy ""Deep Thought"" or a grave pronouncement that is contrived to make you nod knowingly at the author's wisdom. Honestly; I don't do well with ""folksy"" books and this is one of those varmints.
I did like very much the ice hockey setting and the Swedish forest where Beartown is set. I liked the plot and the characters; I just didn't care for how it was packaged and delivered. A little too close to cheesy for my cold; dead; cynical heart. (less)",286,NEXTBOOK

Nor because I like hockey; actually most sports; come from a sports mad family; because I do. No; my rating reflects the fact that this book engaged all my thoughts; all my emotions; in essence I identified with it in a big way. I come from a small town; like Beartown; which suffers from comparisons to the wealthier; little snobbery town to the North. Our sport is football; a sport four of my five sons played from youth on; over twenty years; and that town is our main rival. If no other team is beaten that season but that one; it is considered a victory.
This story embraces way more than the sport though; it also showcases the boys; the coaches; the fans; backers; other students in town and of course the parents. The commitment; the teamwork; the fighting spirit; the bringing together and the tearing apart. The families and what it means to be part of one; responsibilities of teachers and coaches. Friends; the author mentions that the intensity of the friendships formed when you are a teenager are unlike any others and I find this to be so true.
Something terrible happens in this little town; in fact the story opens with an ominous act of foreshadowing. Now it becomes a questions of judgment; town judgment; team judgment; of integrity and being brave enough to do the right thing. The characters outstanding; will never forget Benji; Amat and Bobo; Maya and Ana; young teens with so much on their shoulders. Parenting; what kind of parent are you? Would you look the other way; how would you act? Support without question? Condemn without question? Communities; what does being part of one mean? How can you bring together that which is torn apart? So many questions raised. Applying not just to sports but inclusively to all. As I said a fantastic book; a meaningful one; for me an unforgettable one.
Can't wait to buy this for my 16 year old granddaughter; have already told my two daughters to read and plan to gift this book to my sons. There is something inside it for everyone to find.

I loved the first book I read of this author; A man called Ove. Second book I read; My grandmother told me.... was good; but not as good as I wanted it to be. But this one; Beartown; is out of every league. And it underlines the quality of the author; this story being so different in storyline and style of writing; from his other books. What strikes me is the incredibly human touch of this book on every page. Big tragedy; personal struggles; pain; courage and love combined. Heartfelt. Emotional. Sincere. What can I say; yes; I cried again; yes; it's a five star... Although not the main character in the book; I loved Ramona; the bartender of the Bearskin bar in town... And Benji... And Ana...And Amat...And Maya...
Still have to breath... and think about this book;-) Highly recommended for those who have not read this one yet!
The story in short: People say Beartown is finished. A tiny community nestled deep in the forest; it is slowly losing ground to the ever-encroaching trees. But down by the lake stands an old ice rink. And that ice rink is the reason people in Beartown believe tomorrow will be better than today. Their junior ice hockey team is about to compete in the national semifinals; and they actually have a shot at winning. All the dreams of this place now rest on the shoulders of a handful of teenage boys.

Well I was born in a small town
And I can breathe in a small town
Gonna die in this small town
And that's prob'ly where they'll bury me
-- John Cougar Mellencamp
Beartown is a small town in Sweden; the kind of small town where people are born there; live there and die there; generation after generation. Beartown is; among other things; all about hockey. The lives of those who inhabit this small town are lived around the games; the practices; all the working out in-between. What little funds that are raised there seem to be raised to fund their hockey teams. Everyone makes sacrifices for the team; the game. Teachers; mothers and fathers; siblings; businesses all make sacrifices. The ones who pay with their time; as well; are the boys on the teams; their families; their coaches; and their leaders. Hockey rules all.
Of all those players that excel on and off the ice; there are a few that stand out; but Kevin Erdahl is really their star player. He has everything on the surface going for him â€“ his grades are good; heâ€™s popular with the guys - and girls. His family is one of the wealthiest in town.
Beartown knows it needs players like Kevin to lift this small town out of the slump itâ€™s been in for too long. With a win in the semifinals of the junior tournament; theyâ€™d get attention; maybe more money would trickle down as a result; maybe even the long wished for hockey school this town needs. They all know with a big hockey school in town the rest would follow. The shopping malls; new and improved roads; more money means more jobs; too; something they desperately need. But it all depends on hockey; and hockey players like Kevin; like Benji; even Leo. Hockey is the heartbeat of Beartown.
Hockey is never satisfied being part of your life; it wants to be all of it.
With eyes aimed only the future; really their future; there are changes being planned; another variation of out with the old; in with the newâ€¦ or younger version. The older coach; Sune; will be gone because he gives long speeches about them playing with their hearts; whereas the junior team coachâ€™s speech consists of one word: Win.
And then thereâ€™s also the teamâ€™s GM; Peter Andersson. A former Beartown player who made it to the big leagues; and returned when that dream ran its course. Peter and his wife Kira; a lawyer; have a daughter; Maya; 15 years old; and a son Leo; 12. Leo; of course; plays; and loves; hockey. Maya plays guitar; but life still revolves around hockey; everywhere in town; in her life. Mayaâ€™s best friend who practically lives with them is Ana. And then there's another boy; another hockey player; Amat; who has a somewhat secret crush on Maya. Parties; school; friends; her life; their livesâ€¦ Life; really; revolves around hockey.
They canâ€™t even begin to imagine a life without hockey.
Why does he care about hockey? Because his life will be silent without it.
There is so much more to this story that seemingly appears solely devoted to hockey. There is devotion; single-minded devotion; like a religion; a way of life. One can find similar devotion in other areas of life; other sports; other avenues like reading; or television or video games; but those donâ€™t lend themselves to participation with others; groups of people. An entire town.
Devotion to a cause; to a vision of the future might ultimately be a crack in the armor of a small town. What is a town but a place where people live their lives and dream their dreams? What happens when choices have to be made? What; or who; is sacrificed â€“ and why?
Belonging; that need to feel a part of something bigger; to include those chosen few who share our thoughts and hopes and dreams. If not to be â€œin with the in crowdâ€ then to find our own crowd where we are seen for whom we are.
Loyalty is tied into belonging; to being part of a tribe where we feel at home. Loyalty can be a wonderful trait; but it can also lead people to make decisions based on the wrong criteria. Sometimes making a choice between two roads leads you far; far astray.
Iâ€™ve read all of Fredrik Backmanâ€™s books â€“ at least those that I know of. This isnâ€™t really anything like A Man Called Ove; or My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You Sheâ€™s Sorry; or Britt-Marie Was Here; or And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer - but at the same time it has all the elements of each of those that made them work so well. His ability to deliver that common ground with a character and have you rooting for them; feeling as if you know them; and ultimately to loving them.

It is a hockey town and far too many of the residents financial futures are tied; directly or not; to this sport. Hockey is the business of Beartown and they are poised on the cusp of great success with their junior team this year. Winning is everything.
But when a tragic event occurs the people of this small community are left reeling and suddenly at odds; unsure where to place their faith anymore. It is a inner look at how people; families; teams; those alone and in communities respond in the face of adversity. And it is very well written.
If you have lived in the far north and experienced that kind of cold; then you also know how overwhelmingly appealing the thought of home can be ; like a raw; magnetic sort of pull. So warm and inviting; it comforts and commands your full attention; envelops you and begs you not leave. Best to stay in; snuggle down. This story felt that way to me; comfortable and familiar.
I was actually navigating just fine so I could have done without all the signposts. I kept tripping over them. Sometimes I think it is best to just let the reader do their own heavy lifting once in awhile. We will manage; I promise you.
Four stars for this engaging and captivating story that stayed true; at least for this northern girl.

This is a dark and cold town where everyone knows everyone. A hockey team from whom much is expected and demanded; instrumental in defining the identity of a wide array of characters that inhabit this superlative novel; each providing their pivotal piece to the story. Backmann has truly outdone himself in how he exposes and asks the deepest questions of his characters and the community. It begins with a teenager committing a shocking act that sets the scene for how this comes to be; and the consequent reverberations that splinter Beartown apart as people come to sit on one side of the fence or the other. It is about the complications and difficulties of doing the right thing in the face of those willing to overlook justice and condone the unacceptable for the apparent 'greater good' of the team and the town.
We come to understand the sacrifices; stresses and strains of being on the hockey team; the rivalries; the different values of the coaches; the aggressions; the friendships; the parties and the star team player for whom the only thing that matters is to win. There are the demanding expectations of the team by the rest of the community and their hopes that it will revive the town from its path to potential oblivion. Involvement in the team offers an escape from the complexities and difficulties of real life for the team and its supporters. There are insights into the families of the players; the business sector and others. We see the problem of unwavering adulation and the inability of players to emotionally handle this and contributing to morally problematic behaviour. We see Maya's pain; resilience and courage; her reasons for sleeping at her friend; Ana's home regularly. The wisdom of Amal's mother in emphasising honesty; kindness and for the need to do good. There are so many notable characters from Benji and the amazing Ramona as we see if Beartown is capable of delivering justice with bated breath.
One of the major reasons Backmann's novel is so powerful and successful is that he taps into the universality of passion for sport. The characters with their maelstrom of reactions and feelings reflect their prevalence in any team in any sport and their supporters; connecting every reader to the story. Into this background Backmann throws a metaphorical grenade that rocks an entire community; and this grenade is based on the true realities in a world where some sports team members have engaged in precisely the same kind of despicable behaviours outlined; resulting in communities facing similar issues. This is a multilayered narrative that resonates on virtually every level. Backmann's characters and their development is simply masterful. The author managed to wring a wide range of heartfelt emotions from me; including anger and outrage. This is a story that takes on dark; complex; harrowing issues and deals with them with depth; candour and wisdom. A must read book that I cannot recommend highly enough.

If you are honest; people may deceive you. Be honest anyway. If you are kind; people may accuse you of selfishness. Be kind anyway. All the good you do today will be forgotten by others tomorrow. Do good anyway.
Fredrik Backman won me over with â€Brit- Marie was Hereâ€. I have since read most of his other books; or at least have them in my â€to readâ€™ list; which means I feel I have become accustomed to the authorâ€™s style of writing by now.
However; when this book was released; gossip and loud whispers suggested this one may be a little bit of a departure from what I was used to. However; I trusted the author enough not to let that deter me.
Still; even with those advanced warnings; I found myself ill prepared for the deep impact this novel would have on me.
Hockey is the life blood for â€Beartownâ€™; a small community without much else going for it. While; hockey is â€just a gameâ€™; it takes on new connotations in Beartown.
The junior team is preparing for the semi-finals; and the entire town is beside itself over it. The story centers around the team; the coaches; and their families who are affected by the townâ€™s fever pitch excitement.
We know something went horribly awry from the very beginning. This knowledge creates a sinister and edgy feeling that followed me from start to finish. I understood the mentality of the hockey enthusiast; not because I know the first thing about hockey; because I donâ€™t; but because Iâ€™ve seen that type of hysteria first hand in my own hometown; only with football being the sport of choice.
That a sport can become like a God to be worshiped; that it is responsible for keeping the town afloat; by becoming a source of influx of revenue; itâ€™s success making or breaking the livelihood of the coaches and their families; and being responsible for the morale of the residents in general; is distressing. But; to see kids living their lives without a spotlight on the arts or education; or presented with other opportunities is sad enough; but also seeing them forced into carrying such a heavy burden on their young shoulders is a disturbing and troubling setup.
However; not everyone is defined by the game of hockey in Beartown. Ironically; they seem to end up being the ones impacted by it the most.
Despite the much darker tone of the novel and the high pitch emotions involved; it is important to see the loyalty; the integrity; the courage and intelligence of those who stand up for what is right; consequences be damned. It is uplifting to see family stick by each other; to see those priorities in place; to see rock solid friendships; unlikely heroes; and unconditional love at its finest.
The cast of characters still embodies the authorâ€™s trademark quirkiness at times; but in this novel he doesnâ€™t mask the sadness; anger; or other emotions behind the offbeat charm or dysfunction of the characters; like weâ€™ve seen in the past. To do otherwise would have been an injustice to this story and I feel the author approached this material soberly; handled it with great care and precision; and nailed the situations; as they played out in an all too realistic fashion.
The justice we all feel is necessary doesnâ€™t take place in the orthodox way; but in some ways the powerful equalizer that takes its place is enough to satisfy me. I liked the ending; was pleased by the way things worked out; and the powerful way the author allowed the suspense to build to an almost unbearable pitch while soothingly assuring us all will be well.
Iâ€™m not a person who believes an author must write one dimensional material. Itâ€™s sad that some readers insist they do; often complaining that one book is not exactly like the others he or she as written. I love it when an author steps out and broadens their scope. Sometimes it fails spectacularly; but sometimes it catapults them to an entirely new level.
With Beartown; Fredrik Backman has done just that.

Beartown is also a hockey town where the sport's importance only increases when it begins to become tied into the financial future of the town. When the junior team is actually poised to win the finals this year the whole town starts to become hopeful about the future. Things become tense in this environment when a violent act is perpetrated by one of the boys on the team the night of the semi-finals; leaving the whole town feeling that their future is in jeopardy.
Spoilers ahead. This one was 3.5 stars for me.
I think everyone else enjoyed it much more than I did. I did enjoy it; but I just felt that the story line could have been much tighter. Like there was a lot put into the book that felt unnecessary to the story line and it detracted from it. I might have also enjoyed it less than others because I couldn't help but compare it to A Man Called Ove which completely wrecked me. The story there also unfolds in a much neater manner and everything in the book only seems to add to the story which doesn't necessarily apply to this book.
I especially feel that way about the ending; like that seen with Maya or the four year old girl that eventually grows up to become a star apparently. Neither of those things felt like they had to be put in their. Also adding Zacharias' suicidal ideation was clearly there just to distract us from figuring out who shoots the shots from the beginning of the book but it felt manipulative like it was put in their just to up the tension or suspense. Also the whole things with the shots didn't feel like it had to be a thread running through the book; the books feels like it's supposed to work up to revealing what happens there but it makes such a mess of doing so that it felt pointless to start the book off with that scene. It would've been just as powerful a scene there at the end without opening with it. If anything opening with it just made it distracting through out the book because I just kept wondering about it and it took me away from really getting into the book.
That said I did however enjoy this book a lot and I loved the depth of the characters and the way it went into the themes of a rural town struggling to sustain itself and the way people are treated when they report rape. It was all very timely in this political climate and I think it was handled with nuance and painted a complex picture of all the characters. I really enjoy it when books humanize characters whose actions we may find abhorrent because I think its one of those things we tend to lose sight of in day to day life. I would totally read more of Backman's work in the future; just hope next time the editor tells him to cut out the frivolous details. (less)",293,NEXTBOOK

I had very high expectations going into this one; and while they were met; I was completely surprised by the way this story went.
Turns out I really didn't know what was going to happen; which meant I was constantly shocked.
Beartown is a hockey town first and foremost. If you don't like hockey; don't live here. Or at the very least keep your mouth shut about disliking it. Full of colourful characters; ones I loved (Kira; Peter; Maya; Ana; Ramona; Benji) and ones I absolutely loathed with a passion (David; Kevin; Lyt) thankfully there were more characters I liked than disliked or it would have been difficult to power through.
It started off relatively slow; setting the scene of this bitterly cold and dying town; filling in the background on all the characters. Because of this; it did take me a while to get into; as there just wasn't a lot happening. But once the story arc began I was sucked in! This town is rocked by a police case and suddenly everyone has an opinion - the town is split in half; and I loved finding out what would happen.
At times I was angered by some of the character's behaviour and views; but that is part of what makes this story so great. This is something girls and women suffer on a regular basis - and not being believed is honestly one of the worst things.
This story needed to be told; it is something everyone needs to read; understand and come to terms with. Rape is real and victim blaming second nature; and that needs to change!
""All adults have days when we feel completely drained. When we no longer know quite what we spend so much time fighting for; when reality and everyday worries overwhelm us and we wonder how much longer we're going to be able to carry on. The wonderful thing is that we can all live through far more days like that than we think. The terrible thing is that we never know exactly how many.""

So we always end up arguing about where the boundaries should be drawn. How selfish are we allowed to be? How much are we obliged to care about each other?""
First of all; let me get this out of the way right off the bat since I know Iâ€™m in the minority here. I rated Beartown 3.5 stars and am rounding down rather than up. The short explanation is that I have read Backmanâ€™s A Man Called Ove; My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You Sheâ€™s Sorry; and Britt-Marie Was Here. I gave all of those novels 4 stars. In hindsight; Ove was likely more of a 4.5. I simply didnâ€™t like Beartown as much as those three (emphasis on 'as much' rather than 'didn't like'). I finished reading it more than two weeks ago; and have been letting it simmer ever since; and my initial reaction has not changed. Was it because this one detoured from Backmanâ€™s â€usualâ€™ fare featuring the grumpy old man or woman? No; not at all. In fact; I was glad to hear that we were going to get something diverging from that accustomed theme. I was thrilled in fact! I love Backmanâ€™s writing and have said so before. However; I feltâ€¦ well; icky; reading this book. I know it was meant to be uncomfortable â€“ there were some tough topics raised and I thank Backman for presenting them to us. Itâ€™s an important book.
One thing Backman does exceedingly well is depicting a small town atmosphere. ""The town wakes early; like it does every day; small towns need a head start if theyâ€™re going to have any chance in the world."" He also does a fantastic job of bringing the stinging chill of these fictional Swedish towns right into your own living room - even if you happen to be reading in the broiling heat of summer as I did. Where he really shines is in the portrayal and development of the underdog or the more isolated characters. There are a small handful of them here and I wish I could have seen even more of them â€“ Sune; Benji; Amat; and Ana; in particular. The cast of characters is fairly extensive in Beartown; and I found that when I was just getting settled into some quality time with one; I was quickly jolted into time spent with another instead. The narrative shifts rather quickly; not just from chapter to chapter but within a single chapter. Just a little quibble there.
I have teenagers. Teenagers in sports. We're not obsessed; we enjoy participating and watching as much as we enjoy our other forms of diversion. Thank goodness we have not encountered anything to the extent that those in Beartown have experienced. Actually; the first third or half of the book was what I liked least. The teen culture and angst just didnâ€™t grab me. It actually made me cringe! Likely because Iâ€™m in the thick of it right now â€“ fortunately my two make my life easy; but I see it all around; I hear about it from my own. Mine donâ€™t play hockey; but anyone reading this book knows that you can substitute any sport in here for hockey. For that matter; any event or activity that seems to consume a town; a school; or a family in such a way that it becomes â€¦ unhealthy at bestâ€¦ can be filled in for â€hockeyâ€™ here. ""Hockey is never satisfied being part of your life; it wants to be all of it."" As a family; we make an effort everyday to make sure that we put everything in perspective; not just one aspect of our lives. If you donâ€™t; then I fear a crisis and a moral dilemma like that explored in this book. I have chats with my daughter nearly every day about something that she questions or that she finds uncomfortable. Things she sees and hears about. Iâ€™m lucky she comes to me. Okay; Iâ€™m digressing from the book again â€“ sorry!
Anyway; the second half of the book really picked up for me. When things spiral of control; I was relieved to find that there are those that can overcome adversity and make the right choices â€“ adults and teens both. The alternative is pretty grim and disheartening otherwise. ""All organizations like to boast that theyâ€™re building a culture; but when it comes down to it everyone really only cares about one sort: the culture of winning."" Yikes.
I did like this book - I just didnâ€™t love it as I somewhat expected and hoped to do. But thatâ€™s okay. Itâ€™s more of an â€œitâ€™s not you; itâ€™s meâ€ kind of thing. I still love Backman and his writing and as Iâ€™ve said before; Iâ€™ll read whatever else he writes. Iâ€™d love to read more with a specific focus on one or two of Beartownâ€™s characters in a later book - minus the teen culture perhaps. I need a break from that! Recommended to all fans of Fredrik Backman â€“ chances are; youâ€™ll feel the love.

Beartown is one of those rare novels that leaves you swollen with feeling and utter satisfaction; and yet entirely sad and almost disappointed that the story had to end; even though you wouldn't have wanted the author to change or add a single thing. For me; that's the highest level of love I can have for a novel; and I was honestly stunned by my level of engagement with and adoration for this book. 5 stars; no halves or equivocation; a completely fulfilling reading experience that I'd recommend to anyone and everyone.
Fredrik Backman executes his portrayal of a small; hockey-obsessed; economically challenged town and its inhabitants perfectly: the characters are well-drawn and specific and believable; the details and histories and culture woven into the dialogue and actions throughout. But the beauty of this novel is that Beartown; Sweden is Beartown; Sweden while also being Anytown; Anywhere. It achieves a fantastic combination of the specific and the universal; the small town and the small story and the one hockey team and the one fateful act that are individual and personal. Yet it transcends this to also encompass larger meditations on sport; tribe; the family we choose and family by blood; parent-child relationships; guilt versus innocence and when and why it's important and to whom; suffering; success and failure; fitting in and fitting out; good and evil versus right and wrong; what it means to come of age; what it means to be left behind in a rapidly changing world; what people are and aren't capable of being or becoming.
It's a read that is easy and entertaining in terms of its writing style; but also presents common yet challenging ideas; again amazing and confounding me with its effortless simplicity and profundity at the same time; and for that to happen takes tremendous hard work and craft by Backman. I marveled at how skilled Backman (and his translator) were to keep multiple perspectives and characters popping in and out of the narrative; yet I was never confused and always pulled forward into the plot. And the characters are rich and my need to find out what happened to them was real and urgent and necessary. I won't soon forget Maya's inner strength; the tried and tested love between Kira and Peter; Benji's concealed empathy and understanding; the pain and redemption in the fluctuating friendships between Amat and Zacharias and Amat and Bobo; and even the lesser characters that are still so very real and important and meaningful: Benji's sisters; Ramona the bar owner; Bobo's parents; Amat's mother; Kevin's mother; Sune the A-team coach. Backman answers his own question; sometimes the entire community feels like a philosophical experiment: If a town falls in the forest but no one hears it; does it matter? Yes; because all the people in it matter; their faults; flaws; hopes; dreams; actions good and bad; passions; fears; failures. And even though they are such fully realized characters; it's hard not to recognize yourself and larger strands of the human experience in each of them.
This was something that once I started; I did not want to put down. Ultimately; I was completely entranced by Beartown; and Backman's novel is an exemplar of how to cover the whole of the human condition in a single story; how to juggle and wrestle with the myriad emotions and motivations of individuals and collectives; big ideas like love and loyalty and small needs and desires like wanting a better job for one's parent who is increasingly in pain working as a cleaner. This read is astonishing; emotional; entertaining; and just rang so true. And despite me never reading or having an interest in A Man Called Ove; I take notice of books my Goodreads friends seem to universally rate 5 stars; and was intrigued enough to try Beartown. Backman's other books didn't seem like they'd be for me; so a small town obsessed with hockey seemed a bit more up my alley than what I perceived to be his canon of old curmudgeons on quests and doing adorably cranky things. But after having read Beartown; I may need to get outside of my box and pick up Ove: I was impressed and delighted by Backman's talent and storytelling; and I am so happy he has a backlist I can discover in the interim between this and his next book.
We burn and bleed and cry; fully aware that the worst the sport can give us; in the very best scenario; is incomprehensibly meager and worthless: just a few isolated moments of transcendence. That's all. But what the hell else is life made of?
Beartown will give you 336 pages of transcendence. And at the same time show you exactly what people; what towns; what life is made of. READ THIS BOOK.

Well; I am going to be honest. I was terrified to read this book. A strange thing to say because if a person were to look at my ""read"" shelf; I have obviously highly enjoyed Fredrik Backman's books. I love his writing and his characters seem to connect with my soul. It was the plot- the fact that that this book would talk about a small town and its obsessive love for hockey. A game that I loved so much growing up but have slowly lost interest in as I have grown older. As I began reading ""Beartown;"" I could feel that this book was hitting pretty close to home. In fact; Backman was talking about my hometown. Something I am sure many people can say!
Beartown isn't close to anything. Even on a map the place looks unnatural... Either way the town is losing. It has been for a very long time since it won at anything. More jobs disappear each year; and with them the people; and the forest devours one or two more abandoned houses each season.
Now the focus of this book is a hockey town; its players; coaches; and family members. As the sister and sister in law of hockey players; and the daughter of a hockey coach; I can easily say that Backman captures the very essence of the hockey world. To the perfect pitch!
Late one evening toward the end of March; a teenager picked up a double barreled shotgun; walked into the forest; put the gun to someone else's forehead and pulled the trigger.
This is the story of how we got there.
Yes; it's a dark story too. For what it says about false idols and rape culture and communities and what is truly important. A story that is all too common; but that we(society) must continue to examine. I wish I could say that the actions of the different individuals in the story was shocking; but it wasn't. And that might be the most scary part of all.
Definitely one of my favorites of 2017! (less)",299,NEXTBOOK

What an ending!
Right at the beginning we are told that a teenager goes into the forest; places a shotgun on someoneâ€™s forehead and pulls the trigger. This sets the tension and suspense rolling from the very first sentence.
We also find out that Beartown is a small town somewhere in Sweden where hockey rules; and the clubâ€™s uniforms are dark green; with white trim; and a brown emblem on the front â€“ forest; ice; and earth. The theme of forest; ice; and earth is carried through the book describing variously; the people; the town itself; the hockey club; and how individuals interact with each other.
There is a game description roughly 40% into the book that was so vivid that I felt I had been playing myself! After the game there is a party; and at the party a bunch of young teenagers are drinking; competing for status and placement; and by the end of it life will never be the same for many of them.
This book is about hockey; but it is also about lifestyle; about parenting styles; about how children grow up making choices that are partly due to how they are raised; but also partly due to their personalities and inner motivation. This book is also about how a town can foster pride in accomplishment â€“ and how pride is always a double-edged sword. Pride can be the catalyst for people to excel and pride can also create a sense of entitlement. Actions without consequences. Consequences that lead to tragedies.
And where does it stop? Is a line drawn at the forest? In the ice? In the earth? Who draws the line? Who crosses it because it is there? Who has the courage to stop the spiral before tragedy begets more tragedy?
This story is one of lives and lifestyles careening out of control and what it takes to bring a town back to its truest self again. I loved this story and if you havenâ€™t read it yet; you have a wonderful experience ahead of you!

They are the original fairy tales of humanity and; given the timeless fairytale quality to Gaiman's writing; it seemed to follow that he would be the perfect writer for a book of Norse mythology. He is. In fact; Gaiman seems born to write (or rewrite) myths.
Norse mythology is actually one I've always been less familiar with. I know Greek; Roman and Egyptian fairly well; and some Indian as well; but my knowledge of Norse mythology kind of ends at Odin; Loki; Thor and Thor's hammer. And even then I don't know much about what they all did. To me; this book was very interesting and informative as well as a compelling pageturner.
Gaiman recreates Norse myths in his signature style; with a bit of humour; a whole bunch of complex characters; and a big serving of charm. He makes the stories feel modern and fresh; yet still timeless. You feel like you're reading about millennia-old gods; but it's very accessible to today's reader.
Norse Mythology is told in short stories. Some of the chapters are very short - only a page or two long - and others are slightly longer. I liked how easy it was to dip in and out of. I could go read some of my other books between stories and return to this without a problem. I know ease of reading should not be a top priority; but it is great to find a book that makes experiencing its stories as easy and non-demanding as possible.
It is fast-paced and action-packed; but what shines through most of all is how all these stories tie into important aspects of the real world - as stories about gods tend to do. This is a fascinating portrait of a time and a people who really truly believed in Odin and Loki and their many escapades. It's funny; it's eye-opening; and it's very enjoyable.

I donâ€™t say this out of a sense of personal bias; but with a degree of objectivity. Not only does he write fantastic comics; intelligent childrenâ€™s stories and detailed novels about the nature of godhood (even if I didnâ€™t personally enjoy them all); he also has adapted Norse mythology and re-written it with his modern stylish flair.
He really is a talented man; he is capable of that rare; rare; thing of being able to write fiction that is worthy of literary criticism but is also ridiculously popular and; well; just plain cool. He has many years of writing ahead of him (I hope.) And I donâ€™t think it is too far a thing to suggest that he may win the noble prize for literature in his lifetime. He has contributed much to the arts; and this work here shows he has much more to give. I think he really deserves it.
So here he has retold some already excellent stories. In doing so he makes them approachable and; perhaps even; more engaging for a reader today. I do like old poetry; though not everyone does. I think this can be taken as either an introduction to such works or simply as it is at face value. And it really is what it says on the cover: itâ€™s a whole bunch or Norse stories about some familiar faces. We have Odin; conniving and powerful. We have Thor; strong and honourable. And we have Loki; cunning and ingenious with his own complex intentions. They do battle with each other; with the elements and a whole host of nasties. But not before Gaiman takes the time to provide you with guided tour of Yggdrasil and the nine worlds that take root from her. He clearly establishes the confounds of this mythology before he even begins.
The collection ends with the most appropriate tale of them all; Ragnarok: the final destiny of the gods. It spends the entirety of the collection building up to it:
â€œUntil now I have told you of things that have happened in the past- things that happened a long time ago.
Now I shall tell you of the days to comeâ€
Thus we witness the end of time. The gods fight in one final glorious battle. Loki; naturally; does not fight with the gods of Asgard. Instead he leads the armies of the dead against them. Many of the gods will die; and the pattern will begin anew as their offspring pick up the weapons of their slain forbears; ultimately; taking on their mantels. The cycle continues; as Gaiman captures the heart of Norse mythology here.
What I also noticed is how these tales have affected his other works. Sure; the characters are different; yes; the setting is warped into something else; but you can clearly see how writing this; and researching this; has oozed out into his other projects. This ideas of rejuvenation is repeated in the Sandman series; for example. Gaiman also narrates his personal journey in the introduction; this book has been a long time coming: this topic has clearly helped to propel much of his writing; and it really is worth hearing about.

This is one of the best straight mythology books I've read when it comes to pure enjoyment.
I say this; fully aware that I'm a Gaiman fanboy; and yet; I still mean it. :)
Don't look for fiction here. Rather; look for the source material and a clear understanding of the Norse mythos as far as we have it. So much has been lost and then; there's a ton of fragments. Alas. But what we do have is quite cool.
My personal favorite was the story of Baldur's murder and the attempt to raise him up from Hel's domain. Hel even agrees; graciously; to let him come back from the dead as long as not a single person on any level of the World Tree refuses to weep for the man. Baldur is a sweet man that makes the flowers grow; for goodness sake... and it was a very close race... but you know how these things go.
We all know that LOKI is the reason we can't have nice things. Forget children. I blame Loki. :)
I love the fact that wits and brawn are held in equal esteem; but I sure wish there was a lot more stories about the women. There's plenty of hints. Just lost fragments; however. It's a shame.
Still; what we've got is enough to whet anyone's appetite and I even think this is a perfectly appropriate text for young ones; too. I definitely plan on reading it to my kid once she holds still long enough for it. :) It'll be a nice companion to the The Kalevala and some Greek stuff; too. :)

At least; that's what the Edda claims.
I've always been fascinated with Norse Mythology (and with everything ancient in general). With its strong impact on Marvel's movies; metal music and J.R.R. Tolkien; the AllFather of high fantasy; references to the mighty Gods of Asgard; and the impending twilight thereof; are a part of daily life. Neil Gaiman did not invent a story from the start. He had the material; the facts; the descriptions ready. Yet Norse Mythology is the stellar proof of his tremendous talent and ingenuity; because like a new Odin; he instilled breath in myths existing for thousands of years; he commanded to life frost giants; demons; dwarves; elves; Ã†sir and Vanir alike; and crafted a marvelous collection of stories; ideal to read them in a cold winter's night; next to a grinding fire; holding a cup of warm content; while your mind travels in wild landscapes and flies in the form of a raven; spying the creation of the world and its destruction; only to be reborn again. For in Norse Mythology; it is obvious that rebirth always follows death.
â€œBehind the depth; before the height
Surrounded by the serpent JÃ¶rmundgand
World of man in the middle
Of heat and ice built by the Ymer browâ€
One of the most astonishing things you realise while reading Norse Mythology; is that human minds work in a similar manner all over the world. You can't help but notice the similarities with other mythologies; the traditions of people who thrived miles away. Take the creation of the Nine Worlds for example: there was a flood; one created by Ymer's blood; that destroyed all life only to start it anew. You will notice the same pattern in Greek Mythology; with Deucalion and Pyrrha; in Genesis; with Noah's ark; and many other cultures; like the Aboriginal tribes and the Mayas. You will also discover the origins of the Middle Earth's creation; and the races inhabiting it; and you'll marvel at the parallels between Gjallerhorn; which will be blown by Heimdall at the end of all things to wake the Gods; and the Horn of Valere which will summon the Heroes to battle in Tarmon Gai'don; the Final Battle; in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time. It's chilling; and strangely satisfying.
Odin; Thor and Loki are the main dramatis personae; followed by Freyr and Freya; Baldr and TÃ½r. Through Neil Gaiman's eyes; his witty narration infused with humour; subtle comments and foreboding; you witness Odin's quest for wisdom; and the price he had to pay to acquire it; you will find out how Loki made Sif go bald; and thus the greatest treasures came to the possesion of the Gods; you will follow a strange man's efforts to create the walls of Asgard; demanding to be paid with the sun; the moon and beautiful Freya.
â€œFrÃ¸ya
Blue her eyes
Gold of hair
A maiden so fairâ€
You will shiver before the children of Loki; the serpent of Midgard; the lady of the realm of the Dead; and wolf Fenrir; the demise of the Gods.
â€œI watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a signâ€
You will laugh at Thor's disguise in order to take back Mjolnir; and taste the heavenly mead of Poetry and Widsom; which was made of blood; you'll visit the land of the giants alongside Thor and Loki and you'll be tricked by illusions; you'll search for the apples of IÃ°unn which grant eternal youth (apples of Hesperides anyone?) after the Gods lost them thanks to Loki; you'll see Freyr finding his missing part; you will steal the cauldron that brews the greatest beer; and you will mourn the death of the Sun.
â€œHonour your brother's name; unarmed or blind
Let me aid you in your aim; don't stay behind
Let's maim immortality and death to a deityâ€
You will find out how the first fishing net was created and why; and finally; you will freeze in the Coldest Winter; the prelude to the extinction of mankind; and the Twilight of the Gods.

The fall of the sun
The gates of Hel devour the dead
At the twilight of the godsâ€
Neil Gaiman's pantheon is ruled by the same passions; desires and ambitions with the mortals. His Gods are naive and cruel; spontaneous and bloodthirsty; Thor is not particularly bright (nor as hot as Chris Hemsworth); and Loki is a spiteful creature; a puppeteer; a troublemaker and by the end; you'll crave his suffering.
â€œAsgard's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow the throne
Deceiver!
Deceiver of the gods!â€
Norse Mythology may not be original in its content; but it is innovative and deeply inspiring in its prose; and the blessed talent of the hand that wrote it. It is a quick and relaxing read I highly recommend if you're searching for your next epic adventure!
â€œThor! Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaitsâ€

Gilgamesh from Mesopotamian religion; Izanagi from Japanese creation myth and Zeus from Greek myth. These are a few popular figures from many mythologies around the globe. Iâ€™m here to let you know my thoughts on one of the most popular and well known mythology; Norse Mythology; told by Neil Gaiman with Odin; Thor; and Loki at the center of the lore.
Norse mythology has always been one of the foundations used for most fictional stories in our time. I grew up playing tons of video games that were based on these myths without even realizing that they were based on the mythology in the first place. For instance; Odin as a summon in Final Fantasy franchise; Einherjar that were taken to Valhalla by the Valkyrie in preparation for Ragnarok in Valkyrie Profile series; or Yggdrasil; the tree of life that were depicted in Breath of Fire III but I wonâ€™t bore you with these countless video games adaptations.
Letâ€™s do the most famous example: Thor and Loki from Marvel Universe. This franchise is so damn popular that every time the name Thor and Loki were mentioned; I canâ€™t help but envisioned Chris Hemsworth and Toms Hiddleston as the canon facial features; flaunting their long hair everywhere like theyâ€™re in a shampoo commercial. (No idea why; they just do.)
Picture: Hair of the Gods
Anyway; my point is; Norse mythology is a really important source of material for our current media entertainment and I admit; it has always been one of my favorite mythologies along with Japanese; Greek and Rome mythology.
Norse Mythology is an EXACT retelling of Poetic Edda; the source material of the myth; which is already fantastic in its own way. Neil Gaiman did a great job in adapting the source into a collection of short stories with his own words that made it enjoyable to read; especially for beginner to the myth but for me whoâ€™s been fed with this myth for almost 20 years; I wish thereâ€™s something new to be found here. For those of you who donâ€™t know; the basic outline of Norse Mythology is about the creation of the worlds until the final battle between the Gods and the creatures that will destroy the worlds. In case someone who doesnâ€™t know about the myth stumbled upon this review; I wonâ€™t tell you about the battle itself other than in my opinion; it's always epic; in all adaptations.
Picture: An example of the kind of battle youâ€™ll find in Ragnarok.
I find Neilâ€™s retelling enjoyable to read but I do have two main problems with it.
-First; as I mentioned before; for those of you whoâ€™ve known about this myth already; you wonâ€™t find anything new here; this is an EXACT retelling that it almost feel like a copy and paste to me. I came into this book with the expectation that it will be a full novel with Neilâ€™s own rendition of the myth but nope; you can actually go to Wikipedia; search Norse Mythology and voila; youâ€™ll find the story told here.
-Secondly; this is a really expensive book for its content. It cost $20 where I live and for a 2 to 3 hour read of a story Iâ€™ve heard about almost my whole life is really not worth it. I received this book from my friend otherwise Iâ€™ll feel so robbed personally.
â€œThe Norse myths are the myths of a chilly place; with long; long winter nights and endless summer days; myths of a people who did not entirely trust or even like their gods; although they respected and feared them.â€
Overall; I personally still think that this book is a great introduction to the myth. The original source; the Poetic Edda languages are hard to dive into and itâ€™s more of an info dump compared to this. Despite not finding anything original here; I still find it enjoyable and good to read.
I definitely recommend this to any Norse Mythology beginner; Neil Gaiman did a great job in this retelling and itâ€™s so easy to understand the words he wrote. Plus; Norse Mythology is one of the best myths out there. You owe it to yourself to read it if youâ€™re interested in knowing more about the original tale of Odin; Thor; Loki; Valkyrie; Balder; Fenrir; Mjollnir and many more names; I'll let you find out about them by yourself.

Once upon a time; in that hazy prehistoric time before Goodreads; Neil Gaiman was my favorite author. Sandman was the gateway drug but I read all the Gaiman works I could get my hands on: American Gods; Neverwhere; Coraline; Stardust; you get the point. As the years went by; some of the shine wore off that penny. As I explored Gaimain's influences; like P.G. Wodehouse and Ray Bradbury; some of the magic was diminished.
Anyway; I heard Gaimain was writing this book and my interest was rekindled. I've been curious about Norse mythology since reading my first Thor comic. Gaimain delivers the goods here.
In Norse Mythology; Gaimain retells fifteen Norse myths; from the creation of the Aesir to Ragnarok; the twilight of the gods; making them accessible to the modern reader.
All of the Norse gods you're familiar with from pop culture; namely Odin; Thor; Loki; Balder; and Heimdall; are here; as well as a slew of others like Vidar; Kvasir; and Hod. I was tangentially aware of some of what transpired; like Loki giving birth to a six-legged horse and Odin hanging from Yggdrasil; the world tree; for nine days and nights before gaining his wisdom; but a lot of it was new to me. The Aesir sure liked to booze it up; didn't they?
While there was quite a bit to like about this book; the thing that really stuck in my mind was Naglfar; the ship of the dead made out of fingernails. Really. Loki tying his junk to the beard of a goat for entertainment purposes was right up there; though.
Reading Norse Mythology; I noticed echoes of it in fantasy novels I've read in past couple decades; most notably The Elric Saga Part II and The First Chronicles of Amber. For my money; this is the best thing Gaimain has done since The Graveyard Book (though Doctor Who: Nothing O'Clock was also pretty sweet.) Four out of five stars. (less)",307,NEXTBOOK

A book written by NEIL GAIMAN about NORSE MYTHOLOGY was a book I was going to read. There was no way I was NOT going to read it. Mr. Gaiman might as well have mentioned me in the dedication page â€œâ€¦ and of course Lyn must read this.â€
And I was going to like it. He could have written â€œThey were blond and cold. The end.â€ and Iâ€™d have said WOW! succinctly stated; heâ€™s a genius!!!
Thankfully Gaiman goes into some more detail and has crafted for us a beautiful modern saga of the coolest pantheon in the multiverse. I; of course; revisited Deities & Demigods: Cyclopedia of Gods and Heroes from Myth and Legend and refreshed my memory of these badass northerners.
And like Norman Mailer did with Egyptian mythology in Ancient Evenings; and like Kevin Hearne is doing with the Celtic gods in his Iron Druid books; so too does Gaiman give life and breath to ancient myth. I am also reminded of Tolkienâ€™s The Silmarillion and how he was able to craft a First Age mythos for his fantasy.
We learn that unlike the money making Marvel heroes; these gods and goddesses are complicated and unfit for easy labels and stereotypes. This also made me think of myth in terms of ancient psychological needs and how primitives came up with the gods and their stories. A comparative religion study could trace the similarities in many legends and ancient belief systems. I am especially interested in a comparative study of Loki and other trickster gods like Coyote and Anansi. I was also reminded of American Tall Tales like Paul Bunyon and Pecos Bill and I thought of the origins of these kinds of stories.
And the author of American Gods is uniquely able to make this more than just a history lesson about primitive theology; and also more than just a current re-telling of legend. Gaiman reveals Loki as a colorful and complex rogue who is; like most of these figures; more than simply bad or good. (Although Deities & Demigods does list him as Chaotic Evil). Odin is darker and more mysterious than a grandfatherly figure; heâ€™s cunning; dangerous and unpredictable. Thor is a simple and straightforward brute; sometimes petulant and easily misled. Gaimanâ€™s interpretation of the death of Baldr was also very poignant.
So turn on Led Zeppelinâ€™s Immigrant Song; tap a keg of mead and enjoy!
Recommended for Gaiman fans; myth and legend fans and everyone else; a fun book.

I just freaking love it! â¤
Many gods and goddesses are named in Norse mythology. You will meet quite a few of them in these pages. Most of the stories we have; however; concern two gods; Odin and his son Thor; and Odin's blood brother; a giant's son called Loki; who lives with the Aesir in Asgard.
I have always wanted to read a good book on Norse Mythology and I think Neil Gaiman did a great job explaining some things before the stories.
The different stories were awesome; okay; some were mean and what not but they were just so awesome. Stories of the gods and giants and ogres and cunning and trickery. I just loved it.
This book isn't very long at all and the stories are short but I think they were still great. We don't always have to read big tomes to get good stories =) That being said; I think this would have been a cool trilogy of stories; but that's just my opinion. I would liked to have seen two more books.
I think that anyone that loves the gods will love or like this book. I would recommend it for all of the great stories. I can see how they all wanted to drop-kick Loki across the room =)

Thereâ€™s YouTube and Facebook if some want to engage in such nonsense as fighting over thin airâ€¦.*
Norse myths (aka Odin;Loki;Thor;Freya;the giants;the dwarves; etc.) + Neil Gaiman equals instant;certain; glorious success.This review will be short because what can I say that hasn't been said? And consider yourselves warned because I am going to sound like a major fangirl and I regret nothing:)
World mythologies can be tricky;in my opinion.They're alive;well-known;interesting by themselves.Choosing to use them as a retelling can become a boomerang in the hands of an incompetent author.Naturally;this isn't the case here.Neil Gaiman takes the Norse legends and transforms them into a sequence of tales that may be episodic but are linked to each other in a coherent way; written in a beautiful language that is contemporary and poetic.And most importantly; he approached his material with the utmost respect and wasn't influenced by recent popular teenage notions and Marvel abominations....(I hate those things;sorry....)
His introduction is a wonderful text in which Gaiman explains his deep fascination with the myths of the lands of the North.Let us not forget that in Mr.Wednesday;Gaiman has created a version of Odin that would have satisfied even Grimnir himself.Had he existed;of course.The journey starts with the tale of the creation of the world by Odin;Vili and Ve after the killing of the giant Ymir.Then;we come to know the importance of Yggdrasil;the sacred tree; and the way the Norns hover over the past;the present and the future.All the beloved myths are here.Loki's cute children; the building of the Wall; the marriage of the false Freya;Idunn's apples;the trials of Loki and Thor in the Hall of the Giant king;Frey's search for happiness and the tragic tale of Baldr and many other legends are given new life in Gaiman's masterful hands.And of course;the shadow of impending doom;the Ragnarok; is always present; every time Loki speaks;every time he works on his tricks.The chapter that talks about the Twilight of the Gods is the most chilling description of Ragnarok you will ever readâ€¦.
The narration is smoothly divided between the major deities;even though the Big Three are the focus.Gaiman is the omniscient narrator and allows the reader to sit back; enjoy the tales and contemplate on their epicness.It is not dry or disengaged. It is storytelling in the good; old-fashioned way. Although I was very familiar with the vast majority of the myths; I felt as if I was reading them for the first time.The dialogues are beautiful;without being modernized and each God and goddess have their own distinctive voice.The spirituality that inevitably escorts every mythology of the world is present and the deities are portrayed as complex characters;unlike other recent attempts that tried to portray them as sarcastic;stupid archetypes.Gods are anything but archetypes. Peopleâ€™s minds created them to invoke and communicate all the traits of mankind; the good and the bad; and I donâ€™t think mankind is supported on archetypes.We just have to look closely.After having read The Gospel of Loki; which was a major disappointment;Norse Mythology is more than fresh air.It is Mythology at its best.It is a creation as beautiful as its cover on which Thor's MjÃ¸llnir invites us to enter a realm of beauty;strength and deceit.
""That's the joy of myths.The fun comes in telling them yourself something I warmly encourage you to do;you person reading this.Read the stories in this book;then make them your own; and in some dark and icy winter's evening; or on a summer night when the sun will not set;tell your friends what happened when Thor's hammer was stolen; or how Odin obtained the Mead of poetry for the gods....""

Featuring such characters as Odin; Thor and Loki along with a host of other lesser known gods and characters.
Gaiman does his best to stick to the source material and not stray too far from the myths themselves; writing it in his own language which really brings the stories to life. By doing this; Gaiman has written the perfect place to start if you want to learn more about Norse Mythology in my view.
What really added to my enjoyment was that I had read the Poetic Edda before this; so I had an inclination as to which myths would get the Gaiman treatment.
Itâ€™s basically a collection of short stories; with a large Ragnarok story at the end. Amongst my favourites were:
â€¢ How Thor receives Mjollnir (Treasures of the Gods)
â€¢ When Thor has to dress up as a bride to get Mjollnir back (Freyaâ€™s unusual wedding)
â€¢ The story of the cauldron the Gods want so they can get drunk a lot (Hymir and Thorâ€™s fishing expedition)
â€¢ The mead of Poetry (Mead of poets)
My favourite though; was Thorâ€™s journey to the land of the giants. Itâ€™s one of the longer tales in the book where Thor and his companions are put through their paces in a number of physical contests.
Gaiman stays true to how the characters are described within the ancient myths. The characters are different to what people have come to expect from Marvel films. Thor is a bit of a dumb meat head. Odin is treacherous and ultimately clever. Loki is even more conniving than the film/comic book version.
Gaiman starts the book by saying that Norse myths are his favourites; and this shows with the level of care he gives the source material whilst adding his own spin to the tales. Norsemen also play a large part in American Gods.
I listened to this on audiobook and Gaimanâ€™s narration is great. Something really special happens when writers narrate their own works. The passion comes across when they read their own works. Iâ€™d recommend any of Gaimanâ€™s audiobooks.
Final thought
Gaiman has definitely drank from Odinâ€™s Gift (from the nice end!) and this is a must-read for anyone interested in Norse / Viking history. I already want to reread this; it was that good and itâ€™s short enough to be read in a couple of days. (less)",311,NEXTBOOK

There is no glory without danger
Before beginning the review; I clear out that I read this book as a fictional work not as the work which I believe can be/is true. I am telling you because this book was getting little serious about narrating these myths. Like trying to make us believe these are real facts.
Now; the actual review:
This book is the re-writing of Norse Mythology. Author doesn't exaggerate the facts. He simply re-writes some of the popular myths in pretty straight-forward way. I really liked the writing style.
Most of the myths are about Odin; Thor and Loki.
In the whole fifteen myths; I just loved four:
=> The Children of Loki
=>Freya's Unusual Wedding
[this is hilarious]
=>Thor's Journey to the Land's of Giants
[this myth has some great universal truths]
=> The Treasures of gods
[if you wanna know how Thor got his Hammer; read it]
These are those which I enjoyed the most. Other than these were just fine. Some of them I liked as a fiction. Some of them I didn't even like as a fiction.
I liked Loki. He was clever. Evil. Cause of every bad deed. But he was little good too. I couldn't decide whether he was completely good or completely bad. Thor was also good. I liked reading his myths too. I couldn't like Odin that much. He was just fine.
After reading this book; I wouldn't recommend this book to children. Even though this book is totally fine for them. But still I won't be recommending this to them. I hope some of you have gotten an idea why I am saying this. Believe me this book is totally fine for them. But I am not feeling that they should read this book. Of course when they will have grown-up then there is no harm.
Or the most important thing I almost forgot to tell you that this was my first Mythology reading. I thought these were just like our regular fantasy genre. But now I think that there is a great joy in reading myths as a part of books' plot. Like Rick Reordan's books. Rather than reading the original myths. Don't get me wrong; please!
Nevertheless; this book is good. Highly recommended for those who love reading original myths. But not for children until their mature age.

When something goes wrong; the first thing I always think is; it is Lokiâ€™s fault. It saves a lot of time -- Thor

Interesting folklore told competently; descriptively and cleverly. That's about the gist of it.
Most of the stories were new to me. Some of them I enjoyed more than others. All of the blurbs describe this as Gaiman's ""version/rendition/interpretation"" of the mythos (and he presents a good rendition) rather than actual fiction. As such; this was more of a ""that was cool I'm glad I read that"" read than a ""whoa coolest book ever!"" read.
Favorites: The Treasures of the Gods; Freya's Unusual Wedding; Thor's Journey to the Land of the Giants (all the silly ones with Thor being a doofus) and The Death of Balder

It's something I've been wanting to remedy for a while; but it's a vast subject.
I've known for a while that Gaiman was working on Norse Mythology (for almost 8 years wowza!); and that many of his stories and characters take inspiration from the Norse tales. So naturally; I pre-ordered this one.
I did enjoy this. It's a selection of tales; mostly focusing on Odin; Loki; and Thor; that all lead up to Ragnarok; the end of the world. It's a quick read; and decently accurate. Gaiman retold these stories in an interesting way; in layman's terms; and definitely taught me a couple things I did not know.
I think this book accomplished what it set out to accomplish; but I guess I was looking for a little more. I haven't read scores of mythology books in order to know how this holds up against other existing works; but I stayed present more for Gaiman's brilliant writing style than for the actual stories he chose to retell.
Throughout the book I saw glimpses of some characters I would've liked to hear more about; such as Fenrir; Loki's wolf son. Perhaps substantial material on these gods does not exist; but they caught my attention and I definitely wanted to explore more of their story. But as I mentioned earlier; a large portion of the focus was on Loki and Thor.
I must say though Loki is a very interesting dude... maybe I'm just ignorant but I didn't realize he is literally at the heart of every problem.
From his author's note; I'm to understand that Gaiman would've liked to focus on some lesser known Gods; but that there simply is not enough source material to accurately and effectively retell their tales. While I appreciate that this book exists; I don't believe it is something I'll ever revisit. (less)",315,NEXTBOOK

Of all the fiction in this world; I find the ones rooted in mythology the most enticing; not because there is an element of otherworldly magic in them but because somewhere deep down; a bewitching veil of truth hovers above them. The characters we read of; the prowess we fall to; the betrayals we appall at and the spells we dive in; have all a debatable root which almost like our very own samudra manthan of the Hindu mythology; can be twisted this way or that. As most myths are made lesser of primary evidence and more of a secondary interpretation; there is a hidden little room of sorts from where you can see as far as you can; like Heimdall in this book. He is a kind of parallel to Mahabharataâ€™s Sanjaya.
Neil Gaiman takes the essence of Norse mythology and spins a riveting web around it. Although he makes it clear in the beginning that this book will focus on the three towering characters of Odin; the all-father of gods; Thor; Odinâ€™s powerful son and Loki; Odinâ€™s shrewd; evil blood-brother (and eventual enemy); the chapters easily transcend the trio and throw open an enchanted window to the Germanic myths. Chronicling the journey right from the beginning when nothing existed and going all the way to Ragnarok; the apocalyptic war that wiped the gods and the giants; Gaiman deploys an easy and engaging language to retell the myths that remain fraught with magic; power; bonds; guilt; murder; betrayal; repentance; revenge and redemption. I chuckled at the story where Thor and his two companions are put to a series of illusory tests by a giant who didnâ€™t want his kingdom to be usurped by the mighty Thor. I felt sombre at the unfortunate fate that was handed over to the Hel; Fenrir and JÃ¶rmungandr; the children of Loki from a giantess; just because they didnâ€™t resemble the gods. I read with palpable excitement the battle of skills when the two most accomplished dwarfs; the craftsmen of the Norse world; were pitted against each other to create the most unique gifts for the gods. MjÃ¶lnir; the heroic hammer of Thor; was an outcome of this competition.
For most parts; the chapters were taut and action-oriented. Crisp and to the point; the narrative had a very clear agenda of telling the myths the way they were documented to be told. However; for the keen eyes who look out for detailed landscape and an aura of environment that inevitably leave a mark on the characters and their becoming with the passage of time; there may be something amiss. Questions of morality and immorality; mortality and immortality; lay suspended without direction. Now; perhaps; the objective of this book was to stuff in as many incidents as possible into the terse 300 pages; effectively closing the alternative of detailed painting and reflecting. However; Gaimanâ€™s version remains faithful to the original and one may ditch the expansive road in the favour of a vertiginous fall.

As much as I enjoy reading a collection of myths (even reading them as bedtime stories); this one disappointed me. I am certain that Neil Gaiman has solidified his name as an author of fiction novels but I have only read one book from his collected works so this makes me a Gaiman novice.
Like any mythic fiction; Norse Mythology is rooted from various folklore about natural phenomena symbolized as gods and supernatural creatures. As a kid; I have also had my fair share of readings on Nordic myths like Mr. Gaiman; from reading old novels; online wikis and even other retellings. There is no other way for me to review this novel but to compare it to the original and other retellings.
Although I am not well-versed in all Norse myths; I am well-aware of the crucial tales; from the creation of the world until the end; Ragnarok. I took pleasure in reading from the beginning but the narrative continued to bore me as I delved deeper into the book. Having read countless of the same stories; I needed more creativity. Unfortunately; I did not get that here. For me; this was more of a rewording of the original and not a retelling. If there is anything I got from the stories is that the gods are tragic; even petty.
I hate to compare this to Hotel Valhalla but even Rick Riordan's own middle-grade retelling is way more inventive. This was just lackluster. Regardless; it was still nice to revisit these old tales. I think this would have been a better read if I possessed little or no knowledge at all about Norse mythology. (less)",317,NEXTBOOK

When I was a little girl; I was completely obsessed with mythology. Greek; Roman (or Greek with different names; because Rome was nothing if not unoriginal); Norse; Egyptian; Indian; Native American; Japanese; Russian; etc; were all equally interesting to me. I wanted to know what ancient civilizations believed and why; and how those beliefs still influenced their culture. My faith was important to me and heavily influenced how I viewed the world; so why wouldnâ€™t I be interested in what so heavily influenced other people groups throughout history? As a fourth grader; I was teaching short mythology lessons to junior-high kids before state testing. I loved to learn; and the natural overflow of that love was teaching others. Even then; I always included a segment on Judeo-Christian beliefs; so I could share what I believed as I had shared what ancients believed. I cut my teeth on Edith Hamiltonâ€™s Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes; Bulfinch's Mythology; most of Joseph Campbellâ€™s mythology books; and more.
There was one problem; though. Even though mythology books held incredibly interesting myths; they were generally conveyed like research papers instead of stories. They put forth the tales; but the telling of those tales was generally severely lacking. That was not at all the case with Gaimanâ€™s addition to the mythology genre. He brought in his natural storytelling and breathed new life into the Norse mythos. The book seems small; but writing something of this magnitude was completely outside of his norm; and required more research and tighter restrictions on how that research was interpreted that most novelists ever have to worry about. I respect what he did here immensely; and am excited that now; when a kid develops a love of mythology; theyâ€™ll have access to tales well told.
The adventures of Odin; Thor; and Loki were a pleasure to read. There were a lot of myths that I had forgotten about or never retained due to the clunky writing of other mythology books. Quite a few of these had me grimacing at one paragraph and laughing at the next. Norse myths are incredibly violent. Their creation myth was the bloodiest creation mythos I ever remember reading. But even in Ragnarok; the end of the world as foretold by the Norsemen; there is hope to be found.
I could go into dissecting the stories; but I would hate to spoil anything for someone who is just becoming interested in mythology. But I will say that now I have a burning desire to reread Gaimanâ€™s American Gods. Pick this up if youâ€™ve ever had any kind of interest in ancient beliefs. Just know that this is no novel; this is a faithful retelling of ancient tales; but with style. Youâ€™ll learn something if you decide to read this; and youâ€™ll have fun doing it!

Well; maybe it does. I love everything that he writes and this one is no exception. When I saw he had a new book coming out on Norse Mythology I couldn't wait to get it.
Norse Mythology is a series of stories of myths of the Norse Gods. You learn about Odin; Thor; Loki and many others; how they all came to be. You learn of Asgard; the giants; dwarfs; and more. You hear how Thor got his hammer; and then lost it for a very short period of time. You hear so much of the trickster Loki (and who doesn't love Loki). Some stories are quite short and some a bit longer. Some made me see how mean the gods can be and others made me laugh. I have to admit; I have never read a book of Norse mythology so I can't say how this interpretation by Gaiman compares. I thoroughly enjoyed all the stories and savored this one. I immediately started flying through this book as it's so good; but slowed down just to make it last.
I had the print version of this; because it arrived first. I ordered both the audio and print. The audio is still in my queue and I plan to listen to this one when it arrives. There is nothing better than having Neil Gaiman read his work. It's almost magical. Yes; yes...I did say he IS my literary crush.
Anyway; a great book from Gaiman that gave me some insight into how these tales inspired him in many of his works. Makes me want to go back and re-read American Gods. Granted; this is not my favorite book of his; but a good introduction to Norse mythology. A good book for someone wanting to get started with Gaiman and not exactly sure where to start.

It saves a lot of time.â€
This is my first comprehensive book on Norse Mythology and I was not a huge fan. Everything seems too disconnected. The Gods actions; their reactions; their punishments all don't seem to fit. There wasn't fluidity between one legend and the next - it felt like a bunch of disjointed vignettes featuring the same characters.
But; considering most of my knowledge is based on Marvel movies; I can't tell if bits of the stories are being left out in this rendition; if it's Gaiman's particular style or if this is just how the myths are told. If they are anything like Greek myths; I think it could be just due to the oral traditions being scattered and warped every time they're told.
I did enjoy Gaiman's style of writing. Yes; these tales are ancient but they didn't quite feel so old. Gaiman inserts humor through the word-choice that while likely not a literal translation; it certainly made for better listening.
Iâ€™m not happy about any of this;â€ said Thor. â€œIâ€™m going to kill somebody soon; just to relieve the tension. Youâ€™ll see.
There's such a steep curve for keeping track of the people and things. I kept having to rewind my audiobook to figure out what I missed. Everything; right down to the cauldrons and the hammers have difficult names and sometimes multiple names. However; listening to the audiobook did make it slightly easier to handle all of those names.
Of course it was Loki. It's always Loki.
Audiobook Comments
Read by the author (a definitely plus)...and reading all of those crazy names was difficult but listening to them being said was significantly better for keeping track.

Where do we get the songs we sing and the tales we tell?

Have you ever wondered why some people make beautiful songs and poems and tales; and some of us do not?
It is a long story; and it does no credit to anyone: there is murder in it; and trickery; lies and foolishness; seduction and pursuit. Listen.""
Like Gaiman; I envision these tales being told on long; seemingly everlasting summer nights; and on winter days where the only thing providing light in the darkness is the dancing green shroud of the aurora borealis. Reading his version of the Nordic myths in the family cabin during Yule; surrounded by mountains; fires and snow; was a spectacular experience.
As not only a born and bred Scandinavian; but also a historian of Medieval Scandinavia; I am obviously quite familiar with all the stories found among the pages of this little book. That did not mean; however; that I did not adore Gaiman's refreshing; modernised adaptation of them. This book can be read and enjoyed by anyone; from experts to the uniniated.
Being obsessed with ancient and Medieval literature often means that I find myself completely uninterested in 'modern' classics. But Gaiman's Norse Mythology merges the old and the new in a truly fascinating manner; and becomes something of a classic in the making; reconciling ancient stories with contemporary methods of writing.
Norse mythology is; essentially; the foundation that the modern fantasy genre rests upon. The way this book managed to combine two of my favourite aspects of literature in a single; magical work has turned it into my favourite Neil Gaiman book; as well as one of my favourite books that I've read in recent years.

The book is pretty short and each story is pretty simple and not too tragic; compared to Norse Mythology that I've read on Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes.
There are two things which fascinates me when reading this book:
1. there is hint about real life culture acculturation in Norse mythology with the story of Vanir and Aesir. When I was a child; I was confused with the concept of two countries of gods had war then made peace.
2. Loki is the most interesting character on the book. In earlier chapter; he seems as naughty but still responsible character. Too bad the final chapter; Ragnarok; made all the characters into generic destined-to-die-in-Ragnarok.
I cannot praise this book too much. Maybe it is not Mr. Gaiman fault; but personally I wish more stories about mortals in Norse Mythology; more stories about other gods (e.g. Heimdall is pretty powerful in Ragnarok chapter. A big surprise for a character that only said something useful once prior of Ragnarok chapter); and more explanation of Loki's character. So many plot holes regarding Loki. (less)",324,NEXTBOOK

Predictably; that all went to Hell the moment I saw ""Norse Mythology"" at the book storeâ€¦ I should make more realistic resolutions; because I really can't resist a new Neil Gaiman bookâ€¦
I have always been fascinated with mythology. My mother gave me a copy of Robert Graves' ""The Greek Myths"" when I was a kid; and I must have read it a hundred times; I subsequently devoured every book I could find about the Egyptians and the Celts. But for some reason; Norse mythology had not captured my interest quite as strongly as other folklore. Maybe because when I was younger; I couldn't appreciate how dense and complex Norse myths were: with the Greeks and the Egyptians; it's very easy to tell the good guys from the bad guys; but the Norse seemed to have a more flexible view of such thingsâ€¦ What little I knew; I had gathered from movies about Vikings: I have a soft spot for thoseâ€¦
""Norse Mythology"" is divided into short stories; which gave me the lovely feeling of curling up for story-time. Gaiman's warm and friendly tone certainly plays a big role in conveying that wonderful fuzzy feeling. He has wit and humor in spades; but also incredible love and respect for his source material; which makes his version elegant and engaging. As he mentions in the introduction; so little of the Norse oral tradition made it to us; so the stories he collected here are but a mere fragment of what must have been an even bigger and more complex world. But he begins as all stories must; with the creation of the world; and ends with Ragnarok; the death of the gods. Each story in between links perfectly into the next to give the reader a smooth and complete picture of the stories of Odin; Thor and Loki. He's scratching the surface; but his etchings are beautiful.
I am always fascinated by the way different cultures portray their deities; and the deeply flawed characters of many Norse gods is interestingly telling of how Vikings might have feared and respected their gods; but did not seem to love them. I've always had a weakness for complicated bad boys; so of course; I finished this book crushing on Lokiâ€¦ and I think Gaiman has a thing for him too!
Fans of Gaiman's work will easily be able to see that Norse mythology is at the core of so many of his other stories; it made me really appreciate how long he has been brewing this collection of stories. But it's a fast read; and since it struck me as a retelling; I confess I finished it hungry for more. I think I would have enjoyed the book more if he had fleshed the stories out more fully; by adding and embellishing. But I also know that' s not what he set out to doâ€¦
Gorgeous prose and amazing stories that will leave you wanting more. Neil; you are a tease. 4 stars. (less)",325,NEXTBOOK

If there is one thing you cannot do when you pick up a Gaiman book; it is not reading the introduction. Sometimes I think I read Gaiman only because of his introductions. (Totally untrue. I read him for many reasons; far more than I can count and let alone explain; the most important of which being: me being hopelessly in love.)
I believe I've already mentioned this in my review of The Hammer of Thor by Rick Riordan; but in any case: last semester I took a Germanic philology course; and I might have become slightly more obsessed with Norse mythology than I already was before. And you have no idea how good it is when you read a fine; pleasant; brilliantly written work of fiction like this Norse Mythology; or also like The Hammer of Thor; and you catch your mind automatically picking up on all a number of references; cultural and ethnological data; details of this kind; and you are able to place them in the larger scheme of things. It's personally satisfying; and it also reminds me of the reason why I've been utterly fascinated with mythology; any mythology; and any act of storytelling in general; since I was a scrawny thing with too many bruises on my still unstable legs: they won't allow you to feel alone; ever. They won't and can't; because of their inherent nature: stories; and myths in particular; always refer to something bigger; something more; something else; something that you don't know yet but will know one day; and already; even though you're clueless now; you can feel the pleasure of that future discovery blooming in your chest.
This was the peculiar kind of magic I believed in when I was little.
I still do.
It's all Neil Gaiman's doing.
â€œDo you ever ask yourself how it is that some people can dream great; wise; beautiful dreams and pass those dreams on as poetry to the world; to be sung and retold as long as the sun rises and sets; as long as the moon will wax and wane?â€
More specifically; as for Norse Mythology; it gave me exactly what my heart desired -except maybe the episode of the otter's ransom; because I would have loved to see Loki in that one. I think -I've always thought and rediscovered all anew- that Neil's writing works miracles like few other writers' can: here his style is measured; plain at times; that it to say; the most fitting style for the telling of a myth; and yet it manages to achieve; and always at the rights moments; such levels of emotional charge; that more than once I found myself on the verge of tears or bent double with laughter for the silliest reasons. And in some magical; beautiful way whose mysteries I am not able to disclose; these thousand-year old legends became; if just a bit; Neil's invention.
The characters are humanized in a way that to me is hardly conceivable; considering that 9 out of 10 of their actions are only ""caricatures"" of what a real man could do; exaggerated feats (Hymir fishing full-size whales) or downright ridiculous resolutions (Loki tying his Â«private partsÂ» to the beard of a goat in order to make Skadi laugh). These gods; in brief; felt way more real than I thought possible. (For all that we already knew the adjective ""divine"" would be ill-fitting; to put it mildly.)
â€œLoki's green eyes flashed with anger and with admiration; for he loved a good trick as much as he hated being fooled.â€
But these stories are also fun -and speaking of the devil; guess who's most certainly involved when it gets fun?
â€œOf course it was Loki. It's always Loki.â€
I'm already thinking of when I'll reread these stories in the future; trying to guess where I'll be; and what I'll be; imagining (maybe hoping and maybe not) if; and if yes; then how; they will have changed along with me. That's the Neil Gaiman effect for you; folks: his stories; even they are not really his; but anyway; kind of; have been with me for such a long time that now they are part of my mental setup. Where I go; they always come with me. So; whenever I need encouragement or consolation; a refill of dreams or a magic rush; or even just when I feel like it; I can fish them out; open them up; and lost myself in them for at least a little while.
â€œAnd the game begins anew.â€ (less)",328,NEXTBOOK

Neil Gaiman hammers this one down like a boss.
I'm a slow reader but I was so enchanted by ""Norse Mythology"" that I read all 250+ pages of it in a day. It felt like I was sitting around the campfire listening to Neil Gaiman narrate these stories as I look up into the blanket of stars (two bright ones are the giant Thiazi's eyes!); wondering if Odin; Thor and Loki are smiling down upon us; appeased with Gaiman's dedicated storytelling prowess and the audience's intent devotion.
""Norse Mythology"" is both entertaining and educational. Made up of short vignettes of the lore behind these Norse gods and goddesses; I learnt so much of their backstory I never knew I wanted to know on my own accord. At the end of each story; Gaiman adds his fluid; flourishing touches; sometimes vivid observations; sometimes foreboding commentary that segue from one tale to the next; linking them up together to form an overarching narrative that feels like an epic journey; one that hurtles towards RagnarÃ¶k.
Neil Gaiman's love for Norse mythology shines through from the text so much that it is contagious. That's what storytelling is. (less)",329,NEXTBOOK

My specialty so far has been Ancient Egyptian mythology since I started reading about those gods when I was only 9 years old. However; my second favourite canon is that of the Norse gods. Sadly; because people like the Vikings didn't have written records; most of that mythology was lost. Moreover; the old records that we do have; have been made by men such as Snorri Sturluson; who lived many years later. That also explains why many female gods are either not mentioned at all (we know about them from different depictions on tapestries or other art forms); or only by name/title; never in detail with the corresponding tales. This saddens me particularly - not just because I also want to hear about female gods but because the female gods we do know existed in this canon were doctors (how interesting is it that the gods needed doctors; eh?). And considering what a kick-ass character Freya is; the other female gods would have been very interesting too; I'm sure. The loss of so much of this mythology is also heartbreaking because the little we do know about Norse mythology in general is vivid; funny; and original.
As usually is the case with gods (for example also with the Greek ones); the ones here are deeply flawed: they get drunk constantly; lie; cheat; trick; murder; ... some are married; some even divorced and re-married. As far as I know; this is the only mythology in which divorce is featured; but that is only to be expected if we look at the societies in which Norse mythology was dominant; because people like the Vikings were very open about it. The Norse gods aren't really ""caring"" as many other gods around the world were depicted. Case in point; there are a few animals that get slaughtered continuously as their sole purpose in life (Thor's goats as well as the huge boar in Valhalla; who get slaughtered; eaten; then come back to life; only to be slaughtered again) and there are no stories about humans praying to the gods and sacrificing to them to get divine help (Vikings did that but the Edda never mentions gods actually reacting unlike in other religions).
What makes the Norse gods so special then? Simple: their pathos. And the rich; interwoven details of all the worlds in one of the most colourful and creative world-building I've heard of.
We have Yggdrasil; the world tree
that connects all creation. On its different branches and plains; from roots to crown; there are the 9 realms (Asgard; Midgard; JÃ¶tunheim; Vanaheim; SvartÃ¡lfaheim/Nidavellir; Hel; Nifhel; Muspellheim; LjÃ³sÃ¡lfaheim/Ãlfheim - the names are spelled differently; depending on which text you're reading). In those different realms live different races (Aesir and some Vanir in Asgard; humans in Midgard; Giants in JÃ¶tunheim; Vanir in Vanaheim; Dark Elves or Dwarves in SvartÃ¡lfaheim/Nidavellir; the dead (not died an honorable death / on the battlefield) in Helheim and Nifhelheim; the Fire Giants in Muspellheim; and the Light Elves in LjÃ³sÃ¡lfaheim/Ãlfheim).
We also have messengers such as Ratatoskr; the squirrel that runs up and down the trunk of Yggdrasil to deliver messages (often lies); snakes and deer around the world tree and an eagly in its crown. We have Odin's ravens; Hugin and Munin (thought and memory); we have Sleipnir; the eight-legged horse of Odin (actually a child of Loki); we have mountains and valleys; oceans and rivers; ...
Our main players in the Edda and therefore also in this book are the Aesir such as Odin and Thor; but also some Vanir like Freya and her brother. Moreover; we have Loki; a giant who nevertheless appears like an Asgardian (probably because he's a shapeshifter; he can turn into a mare; too; for example) and lives with the Aesir. The stories depict the gods' adventures; such as Odin wanting to build a wall to protect Asgard and forcing the giants to pay for it (I kid you not).
Many of the stories are incredibly funny - like when Thor has to dress as a woman to get his hammer back or what happens to Loki when he transforms into the above-mentioned mare to cheat the builder of the also above-mentioned wall.
But there is tragedy too. Most of all because Ragnarok (end of days). The gods have always known about it; know that they will be defeated during Ragnarok and yet they are prepaing for it (it's the sole reason for Valhalla where Odin collects all the best fighters). Think about that: they already know the ending and that it cannot be changed; but they will at least go out in a blaze of glory and take as many enemies with them as they can. A powerful message.
Then again; much of Ragnarok (if not the entire thing even) could have been prevented had the gods behaved more honorably in the first place.
My favourite character in the entire canon is Fenrir;
son of Loki and a giantess (yes; Loki cheated on his wife; 3 times with this giantess and once by becoming a mother himself); the giant grey wolf who would have been a friend to the Aesir had they not tricked him cruelly out of fear.
Remarkable about these myths is also the implications; what they tell us about the Norsemen. It is clear to me that they did not necessarily love their own gods; and definitely did not trust them. But they respected them and learned from them. They knew them to be treacherous but that only made them be on guard; using wit on top of physical strength themselves because they could see the value of the combination of brains and muscles (a very interesting effect)!
This book presents the myths in their original form (as given to us in the prosaic and poetic Edda) but slightly fleshed out with Neal Gaiman offering some descriptive details; basically giving the stories a face-lift; without changing the tone or content. One can tell that the author knows his stuff and has a deep passion for Norse mythology (especially for Loki) so this book was written with the utmost respect to the source material. This respect; in fact; is palpable; making reading the stories a delight.
As a huge fan of Norse mythology; I'm actually overjoyed at what Neil Gaiman presents us with here and hope that he manages to reach a wide audience so the myths will live on (not just in Marvel comics and movies). (less)",330,NEXTBOOK

â€œSomewhere in the distance; somewhere in my bones; thunder rolls.â€
If Red Queen was a game of charade and Glass Sword was a game changer; then King's Cage is a reincarnation of the two; manipulation and war and survival and politics woven into its essence; but on a whole other level. No longer a hide and seek playground; but a chessboard where powerful masterminds control kings and queens and princes and princesses and many; many pawns to fight for the ultimate trophy -- the throne of Norta. Organized chaos that was delicious to watch unfold.
Glass Sword ended with a jaw-dropping twist that meant the focus in this continuation will transfer to the dynamic between Mare and Maven. I stopped comparing Maven and The Darkling a long time ago and rightfully so -- whereas with The Darkling I always felt an inkling of hope for redemption; with Maven there is only the clinical dissecting of his behavior and attitudes that give no room for such innocent naivety. What brought me emotionally to my knees was not the revelation that he really is a pawn through and through; even after his mother's death; but that he is aware of it and he accepts his damned fate; molding to the villain persona by his own accord. He is a four-geared system that runs on hate; anger; fear and twisted love. Maven is a victim and you cannot help but feel pity for him. The what ifs of what he could have become without Elara's interference are a stark reminder that monsters are made; not born.
â€œThe pain makes you stronger. Love makes you weak.â€
Maven's obsession with Mare is another side-effect. It's honestly so sad to watch his inability to change and to love normally. His mind is perpetually assaulted by paranoia and loneliness; continuously eating at his ghost of a soul. He astounds through his cunningness and cleverness; many underestimating him. But he is his mother's son; after all; and the legacy leaves behind both scars and advantages. Mare is the one that knows him best and they use each other to survive a royal cage that; paradoxically; suffocates them both.
Mare Barrow goes through her biggest character development yet. Our heroine grows so much; even through trauma. I love that; despite the fact that she has been put through hell; she doesn't let herself get sucked into the void. She still smiles; she still loves; she doesn't lose hope. Her sparks; even though kept away in tangible form; reside inside herself and allow her to live. And I loved the fact that she is portrayed in fear lots of time -- it doesn't make her weak; on the contrary; the fear brings out her deepest survival instincts; giving her a shot of winning the battle against greater opponents that loom over her shoulder. Much like Maven. And goddamn it; she fights; with her mind; with her body. She fights to not become a skeleton trapped in a prison; mentally and physically.
I also adored her demeanor towards Maven; taking advantage of his weakness for her; but always trying to bring him on the right path. Their dialogue is beautiful; mirroring two broken souls; trying to outsmart each other. They find refuge in one another; no matter how twisted and toxic. And Mare; at least; finally gets a clearer picture about this plague of a boy.
â€œShe was his hurricane; and every nudge pulled him deeper into the eye of the storm.â€
May I please fangirl about Cal? This romantic; strong; intelligent; caring; naive; hot; intense; good fucKING SILVER PRINCE THAT TAKES THE WRONG DECISION AND CANNOT CUT THE CRAP OF THOSE WHO WANT TO USE HIM AND CANNOT KEEP HIS PROMISES. Sorry. That must have been a bit harsh. But it's the truth. I honestly love him to bits. His love for Mare turns me to a blubbering mess. His hope for Maven is crushing. His friendship with Kilorn warms my heart. But fucking hell he's still Prince Tiberias the Seventh and his identity bites everyone in the ass; especially himself. AND HE'S A GODDAMN STUPID IDIOT. Okay; I'm done ranting.
â€œItâ€™s not his fault the lightning girl loves him; and he must bear the curse that love brings with it.â€
The romance between this sweet yet insufferable young man and our dearest Mare melted my heart. The mutual support; the understanding; the goofiness; the sexiness; the courage to break stereotypes... ALL OF IT is just wonderful. *sigh*
I need to give lots of claps for one character in particular; or rather Aveyard's flawless constructing of it; making me feel something I have never contemplated in the first two books: love for Evangeline Samos. However; don't imagine something along the lines of the sudden angelic rendering of Celeste in The One; for instance. Far from it. Evangeline is still the quintessential bitch. But I adored how she upgraded from a mere queen-wannabe that has only arrogance; ambition and jealousy as main traits to a deeply intriguing; multi-layered and surprising anti-heroine. Again; readers can regard her as another one who was made. Made for being a queen; made for being perfect; made for her family's well being. We have her POV as well; not necessarily as a mechanism to see from a different perspective; but to offer further glimpses into a universe governed by politics; secrets; manipulation and; of course; power. Throughout it all; she remains strong as steel; kickass and terrifying; splendid when she is gradually humanized through the unraveling of her desires and fears in a manner that highlights her internal conflict: freedom and love or duty and submission?
â€œBe the best; the strongest; the smartest; the most deadly and the most cunning. The most worthy. And I was everything.â€
As usual; the secondary characters pretty much rocked. Farley is awesome. Julian is awesome. Sara is awesome. Kilorn; we don't see as much; but he is comforting in a familiar way. The whole Samos family is pretty much badass in a disturbing way and I devoured their scenes. The Colonel; a Premier named Davidson; newbloods; Reds and Silvers alike expand the borders of what we previously knew. Old queens; new kings; ruthless princes and princesses and faraway commanders make up the backbone of the Lakelands; Piedmont; Montfort and; of course; Norta; forging the world-building aspect.
The rhythm had some off-beats here and there. Personally; I associated them with Cameron's POV. She was a bit hard to stomach; even though she is definitely the no-bullshit type. Progressively; I learned to like her; but the reason why I cut down on the rating is partly thanks to her as well. The other motive is the fact that Mare's imprisonment to Maven; although seductive and psychologically-embedded; was slow-burning in a frustrating way; grating on my nerves for the lack of action. It was like I was simultaneously wasting away along Mare; unable to speed up the process.
The ending of this book left my heart in shambles; because I saw it coming miles away. Didn't lessen the pain though. It leaves the story at a precarious tipping point; a crossroads of a sort; with certain revelations confirming what I've been dreading: the last book will equate to death. As a dedicated fangirl; I fear for my mental stability after the next installment closes the story.
King's Cage is a great follow-up in a thrilling and exciting series. The story of this novel will have resounding echoes in the last book (ohmygodjustonemorebook). The grand; masterful blend of action and politics and romance had my head spinning; awed; and the characters infuse a unique vibe to an already mesmerizing mix of dystopia and fantasy. I cannot recommend these books enough.

King's Cage.
KING'S CAGE.
It's about a king in a cage but also a girl in a cage made by a king! OMG! Do you get it? Do you get the symbolism? Are you impressed yet? Are you impressed?
Lady; save it; please. I got halfway through this and I just couldn't do it anymore; so I ended up donating it. For that reason only it was worth Â£10.99. I hope the person who got this book really enjoyed it and got a lot more out of it than I did because I was spitting tacks the entire time it was in my hands.
The truth is that this series seriously pisses me off. Maybe that's over the top (granted; as a person; I am fundamentally over the top) but I am sick to death of books like this that are nothing but overblown cash-guzzlers. This book has nothing of value to add to the conversation and yet it thinks it does; and it has the gall to try to be ""current"" and ""political"" when it's about fucking nothing. I feel the same way about this series as I did about that Bone Season thing and bitch; do not get me started on The Bone Season. That book can see me next bloody Tuesday.
Why does this series rile me up so much? Probably because its so unbelievably redundant; and yet it pats itself on the back for being so clever; all the time. 'Oh; look at me;' this book says. 'I'm so in tune with current events and politics and I stand up for what's right!' But you don't. You don't add anything new and you certainly don't add anything from a perspective that I'm remotely interested in. I was promised ""grey"" characters; and that's certainly what I got: grey; dull; empty; lifeless cardboard cutouts stumbling around an underdeveloped plot; pulling the wool over my eyes while it serves as pure filler until the last book in this series. This series was never meant to be four books - it was supposed to be a trilogy; and it should definitely have stuck to that; because what we've got here is something like five hundred pages of nothing; while the narrative shamelessly BEGS us to get on board with Mare.
I am never going to like this heroine. Ever. I don't care how hard TPTB push the narrative that misogyny is the only reason why nobody likes her. I hate Mare because she is a shite character with shite inner monologue that I genuinely could not care less about if I tried. I don't care how forcefully the other characters in these books try to construct a personality for her - she doesn't have one. She is a limp; wet piece of lettuce. She is a period stain on the underwear of literature. I cannot stand her; and I am not about to lie down and accept being told how I feel; as if a marketing team knows me better than I know myself. I'm not about to accept some bullshit allegation that the only reason I hate her is because she's a woman. Like?? What?? Don't. Like I said; save it. People hate Mare because she is toxic and moronic and her narration is so laughably self-serious; peppered with these cringey outbursts of ""snark"" or ""sass"" that don't come close to being relatable or entertaining.
Let me tell you something: I loathe this ""spunky; sassy"" thing. It is a piece of nonsense. What woman can relate to that. Women; please tell me if any of these heroines that have been labelled ""spunky"" have been relatable to you. Because to me it sounds like a lot of bullshit. It sounds like a cliche; like a patronizing mockery of women who actually are dryly funny; who stand up for themselves; who are clever with their humour. I am not ever going to buy this ""sassy heroine"" thing. Do you know what it sounds like? I sounds like the heroine is going to be dry and hilarious and outspoken. Do you know what actually ends up happening? The heroine has an unfunny; grating inner monologue; and when she cracks some lame half-joke that isn't remotely amusing; all of the male characters around her will pat her on the head; sigh; and fawn about how she's ""one of the guys"".
I'm not keen on Sabaa Tahir's current series; but I do genuinely like Sabaa Tahir; and when she stops writing that Ashes in the Night thing; whatever it's called; I will read more of her books; because she is an author who; despite all of the issues I have with her works; never fell into this trap. She didn't do that bloody ""snarky heroine"" thing. It has no place in this sort of self-serious book. That's not to say that self-serious books can't have dry; funny heroines; but they have to be written smartly; and smart is the last thing this book is. If this book is smart; then my ass; who can't even do the seven times table; is a fucking mathematical prodigy.
Here's my problem with this series: there has never been a time when it wasn't generic; and that's a given; but with my hand on my heart I can say that the first book had promise. It was fine and even enjoyable in parts. But you only have to look at the ratings for this series; and the dying hype; to see that along the way; something has gone seriously wrong. I don't know if the spark just died; or if marketing pressure forced the author to stretch this series into four books - but what I can tell by reading it is that this is not even close to this author's best work. Since posting this review; I've been heckled and hounded and cursed at; but I will not change my stance on this; as it seems more and more apparent; the more I learn and think about it: this is not a passion project. There is no fire and brimstone in the writing; storytelling; or character arcs. There has been no love and devotion put into it. It is dry; sallow; and clinical. It's depressing; but not for the reasons that it wants to be.
The more that I think about this; and the more desperate stans tell me that I'm stupid and can't read (nice try. Bye; Felicia) the surer I am that something went wrong here. Ratings for series generally go up with each book; as people who didn't like the premise or the writing drop off after the first or second book; thus the people who're going to pick up the last book are generally fans or at least keen on the series; it's very unusual to have peaks and troughs in ratings as this series does. I do wonder what happened; and I wonder why the hype was so pithy upon the release of the last book in a series that must have taken about 5+ years to write in full. So what the hell happened? This book is just such a fucking fail. It's just phoning it in and that's not good enough.
After the second book in this series; I told myself no more; but Glass Sword wasn't bad enough for a DNF. I got through it. But this marks never again. I would rather do that 1000 DEGREE GLOWING KNIFE thing on my own foot than read the fourth book. I would rather rub chillies in my eyes.

DEAR MARE; STOP PICKING THE WRONG BROTHER.
***Warning; spoilers abound; do not continue with this review unless you have read the book.****
First of all; I CALLED IT. I KNEW that we'd be getting lots of Maven and seeing the boy behind the villain's mask in this one. And PRAISE THE BOOK GODS; I'm so glad Victoria didn't let me down. She gave us all those moments we hoped for; the explanation; the moments of fragility; the tension; everything... She gave me a beautiful; tragic; tormented villain who fell in love with the wrong girl.
....I say wrong because Mare does not deserve this Darkling; this twisted Warner of a king. Her reaction to his kiss; during the vulnerable tenuous moment between the two was what finally convinced me to give up on their love story (whereas in Shatter Me you could pick up on something in Warner & Juliette's kiss; here there's nothing. It's gone; alright; I get the message. Mare feels nothing but disgust; it's a ""violation of the worst kind"" -she's in control and she'll never pick the villain). While I have never felt the spark between Mare and Cal (yup; even in this book including that scene); she's never going to be Maven's. That's fine; I'll take him. Mare doesn't deserve him; even though Maven is more like her than Cal will ever be.
This is a boy who was crippled from birth by an evil woman so terrible he doesn't know what thoughts are his. I just want him to have a happily ever after. But there is none. This boy is darkness incarnate and I have a feeling he's going to end up doing something noble to save Cal or Mare or his people in the next (final) book (to redeem himself the only way a villain can) and I just can't cope.
The first book is still my favorite; but King's Cage gave me so many beautiful twisted lines. Victoria is a master of powerful prose; and she delivered some exceptional ones --as you might expect; my favorite ones were his.
""Love makes you weak. And she's right. I learned that before I even knew you.""
""I'm not a fool; little lightning girl. If you're going to play in my head; I'm going to play in yours. It's what we're good at.""
.... I could try to write a review of this entire book; but let's be honest; I read it for Maven and I don't have the heart to write everything up because I'm in mourning for a ship that will never sail.
(yes; I realize Maven does not have blonde hair but this gif fits perfectly)

You can seriously feel the work that went into developing everything here. (And there aren't any major spoilers in this review; but I did drop some book quotes in... so you have been warned).
First things first: I went into this without many expectations because I loved Red Queen but really wasnâ€™t huge on Glass Sword. So maybe give this one a shot even if you didnâ€™t like the second book. I do get the complaints about Glass Sword! Mareâ€™s personality or way of handling her situation got a bit too unrelatable for me in that book (I just didnâ€™t want to sit through that much of a sulky; withdrawn narrator). Plus; it was hard to get a sense of Maven as a villain since he wasn't around much. I summed up the second book with: ""the majority of this book felt like it happened offstage or danced around any real character growth; plot development; and romance. It was mostly super depressing.""
I was shocked by how much I connected with Mare and the whole story here; though! Everything worked for me. Thereâ€™s a much stronger sense of unity and solidarity among the characters; tooâ€¦ like thereâ€™s HOPE and something to get behind. The plot still felt more like Glass Sword than Red Queen; but the character growth and world were so strong that I loved it.
The story starts with Mare as Maven's prisoner; but gets wonderfully complicated as it delves into their twisted relationship. It's all just SO WELL DONE. Maven's mother literally molded his mind throughout his life to the point where he's no longer sure which parts are his own. She even turned his love for Mare into an obsession. And there's still a small part of Mare that cares about Maven (or is at least empathetic) even though she wants to kill him:
He is a monster still; a monster always. And yet I can't stop myself from listening. Because I could be a monster too. If given the wrong chance. If someone broke me; like he is broken.
Monsters are made. So was Maven. Who knows who he was supposed to be.
The story never excuses Maven's actions; by the way. Victoria Aveyard is very clear that this is not a relationship that will ever be good (or happen). So even though I donâ€™t ship Mare and Maven; I still LOVE how complicated everything is between them.
He stares up at me. ""Those who know what it's like in the dark will do anything to stay in the light.""
""Don't act like we're the same.""
""The same? No."" He shakes his head. ""But perhaps... we're even?â€
Stories with black & white characters or shallow villains get old for me really fast because it's unbelievable. Maven's character completely worked:
""You think I enjoy seeing you like this? he murmurs. ""You think I want to keep you a prisoner?"" Something hitches in his breath. ""It's the only way you'll stay with me.â€
Even though I know what he's doing; even though I can feel his grip on me tightening; I can't stop it from pulling me under. It would be too easy to let myself drown. Part of me wants to.
So Mare's dealing with a lot of grief; loneliness; and PTSD; but the way it's carried out in this book is super realistic. She's totally broken and starts to feel gratitude to Maven for the most basic acts of humanity. Watching her grapple with everything was actually one of my favorite parts this time around. She somehow finds the strength to fight again and is a totally relatable character you WANT to support. All of her thoughts and actions make sense and she has so much growth over the course of the story:
It would be easy to stay in the dark; to drown. Slowly; I lower my hands and force myself to look at the sunlight.
And Maven's actually a really smart king and knows he has to win the Reds over to his side. I won't spoil the main plot; but the politics get awesome as we learn more about the history of Red oppression and see different kings take action on their own plans.
The other main POV is Cameron; who's still searching for her brother. She's a great character and her insights balanced the story by sharing what's happening with the Scarlet Guard and showing another side to people like Cal and Mare. Lines like ""no wonder [Mare] has personality issues. No one tells the girl the truth about anything"" helped me get past how the two girls acted in Glass Sword. And Cameron's observations make it even more clear how Cal refuses to actually take a stand or pick a side. He was another character with painfully realistic flaws... aaaand I suppose I thought the romance was sweet; but I'm not really here for any ship.
Ooh I almost forgot -- the ongoing theme of how weâ€™re all partially made by someone else came through even more in Evangelineâ€™s POV. (Speaking of how this book surprised meâ€¦ how is Evangeline my new favorite character?! Did not expect that). Just seeing WHY she did everything and how she handles the heartbreaking situation sheâ€™s in definitely made her more sympathetic. I wouldnâ€™t mind an entire book just about her!
OTHER AWESOME STUFF I LOVED:
- The acknowledgements are not messing around
- A major character turns out to be gay and itâ€™s not her defining story
- Mareâ€™s skin is straight up described as â€œbrownâ€ several times instead of dancing around some kind of â€œtan/sunkissedâ€ vague description. The on-page PoC rep is clear
- the story deals with PTSD well
- EPIC BATTLE SCENES omg so manyyyyy
- there were still funny parts despite depressing circumstances
- less animosity between female characters
Oh; and all of the YA author shoutouts were hilarious! One line is â€œCaz; Brecker; with us!â€ and then there's a part about â€œDaraeus and Alexandrat are sworn allies to Bracken.â€
So yeah; ""King's Cage"" turned out to be the most brilliant title ever. Everyoneâ€™s trapped in some situation or cage by one king or another (even Maven is in one of his own making). The ending was super intense and I loved it all. This series really is one of my favorites now!!

To be fair...the author tried to warn me.
To keep this review from getting as long (and as bloated) as the book; I will focus on the three worst aspects - the prison; the characters and the sexay scenes.
Mare's Prison or should I say; my vacation?
The entire book consists of Mare whining about how difficult life was...It's just...come on. Really? What does she have to whine about?
I've been broken too many times to break again.
Her ""prison"" includes: A private bathroom; a personal library; meals three times a day; makeovers; fancy gowns and kingdom tours. Sign me the f*ck up
But like a dog starved; Iâ€™ll take whatever scraps Iâ€™m given. Whatever passes for kindness in this lonely cage.
Really; REALLY Mare? What scraps? You were invited to be a bridesmaid at a royal wedding. oh boo-hoo
To top it all - Mare gets PTSD flashbacks. PTSD flashbacks after her eventual rescue. Girl. Are. You. Kidding. Me. Your prison is a $500-a-night hotel stay.
The Characters or should I say; the CHARACTER??
Now; one annoying character doesn't spoil the book - unfortunately; this was not the case because Every Character is Mare.
I listened to the audiobook and each perspective had a different ""voice"" (posh for Evangeline; British for Farley and ""black"" for Cameron (yes; picture a stereotypical ""black"" accent with a hint of Jamaican.) (no one else has that accent; just the sole black girl perspective)).
Without the clear distinctions brought on by the audiobook; telling apart the characters became really difficult. Therefore; I've written a cheat-sheet for those who only have the text:
How to tell your Mare from your Mare -- 101
--Original Mare: Whiny; self-pitying garbage human. She regularly kills people and only feels ""remorse"" when convenient for the plot. She literally was made into a princess-to-be but threw it all away cause she had to read a paragraph of propaganda
--Cameron: The younger; whinier Mare. She's the token diversity character and manages to ""hate"" Mare while simultaneously admiring her. She constantly refers back to her intricately braded hair...because she's the only black character. The author uses these ""subtle hints"" at her skin color every freaking time we are at her perspective.
--Evangeline: The older; posher Mare but with SURPRISE SHE'S GAY twist. This came out of the blue. It honestly feels like Aveyard threw the twist in because she needed to fill her LGBT+ quota.
--Farley: Pregnant Mare; anyone? Manages to run an entire army while growing a tiny human yet everyone is more impressed with Mare surviving ""prison."" Farley has a hardcore British accent yet no one from her hometown (or her family) has that accent. The accent is possibly the greatest mystery of this series.
--Cal: What would Mare be like if she was a guy?
--Maven: What would Mare be if she was an EVIL guy?
The ""Sexay"" Parts or should I say the wet blankets?
Now; I'm all for a little bit of a YA smooch-a-roo fest but...these scenes just had me going ""ewww"". Honestly; what is with authors making every boy have a unique taste? For example; Cal's mouth tasted of:
salt and smoke
and I'm hard-pressed to think of something less appealing thing to stick my tongue in. How does that even happen?
Then; there's the awkward bath scene. Picture this: Maven; naked in a bath; bubbles up to his ears; a bit of pre-pubescent chest hairs waving in the water...as he has a complete conversation with Mare.
BUT - don't worry; our demure heroine wasn't tempted to look because she's:
familiar with the male form
after living with her father and brothers. Shudder.
And then; just when I thought we were done with the awkward scenes...we reach... The SEXY mud-makeout.
Let me set the scene: It's cold; it's raining; there thick clumps of soggy mud everywhere...and Mare says; let's make out hunkysugarbear. Mare tosses her shirt in the mud and throws Cal's in the mud too.
Excuse me?
You're in a forest; at least throw it on a bush. Who wouldn't be pissed if someone threw their stuff in the mud? Cal. That's who. Cause he was too busy downing a liter of salt and setting it on fire to get ready for his big kiss.
I think I'm getting too old for this.
Audiobook Comments
Read by Amanda Dolan. Now it could be because I absolutely hated this pointless waste of paper...but I disliked the audio as well. Everything sounded so bland. Bleh.
Also; it really bugged me that when we swapped perspectives; the accents of all the other characters changed slightly. Is consistency too much to ask for?

Boring writing style. Disintegrated storyline. Dull characters. Flat villain.
King's Cage is a bipolar book. Everything is swung up and down all the time; especially the characters being unstable and intermittent. I'm beyond disappointment and frustration; even though I didn't expect anything at all before reading; I still feel as if this book is a waste of my time. If you think Glass Sword was terrible; you would be terribly wrong because this book was ten times worse that I couldn't be so sure whether I was reading a book or a screenplay.
â€œI've been broken too many times to break again.â€
King's Cage has its loop since the beginning: one; the description of the scene; and two; the description of the costumes; and three; the character progresses their own stories. Then it's back to the first step again and again. One and two and three. One and two and three. UNTIL THE END OF THIS BOOK. It keeps repeating without changing the tactic of narrating the story. I haven't known how dull Victoria Aveyard's writing style is until now. Her writing is getting worse and worse compared with Red Queen. She wrote this book like doing a screenplay and had no idea how disastrous it was for the gap between chapter 28 and chapter 29. The action scenes are the worst of all. They're scattered; hell; this isn't a comic that you can skip the scenes because you have illustrations to substitute it. A novel needs details to complete actions and a story needs skills to weave it carefully; not just putting a piece of them and you call it a novel. Yet VA does that all the time. She skips the scenes incessantly I wanted to stop reading many times if it wasn't for the cost that was worth my three meals; perhaps four.
However; I can conclude this book into one paragraph below.
(view spoiler)
â€œTo stand in front of a person who is your whole world and be told you are not enough. You are not the choice. You are a shadow to the person who is your sun.â€
3 Stars for Red Queen for its awesome plot and setting. 2 Stars for Glass Sword because I didn't like Mare at all. She was such a brat in that book and her character made everyting awful. And 1 star for King's Cage. This book is utterly terrible; in my opinion. It is a black void of space with the story floating around and is impossible to grab. The worst book I've ever read in almost two years. Oh! and the ending is forced; too. I couldn't believe that would happen; whether the author intended to do it this way since the beginning or not; she should have been more elaborate.
0 for the story and 1 star for shirtless Cal and his abs.
I don't care who Mare will end up with. Cal ? Meh ! Maven ? I feel nothing for him. Kilorn ? I'm not surprised at all. Or she will probably die at the end of this series. Yet It doesn't bother me any.
â€œYou arenâ€™t alone.â€ The hope in his eyes cuts deeply. â€œYou have your crown.â€

So politic and sh*t this wrench my gut.
What can I say? This series kept more and more like a dystopian fiction; more than being high fantasy. However; I like this one a bit better that Glass Sword due to politic game; more Maven; and because THIS ONE GAVE ME MANY FEELSSS *angry* *giddy* *angry* *giddy* and then *wrathhhhhh*; not made me all bored like GS!
1. CAl & MARE and Politic attitudes.
I love that the characters are not totally black or white. There are what they are because of how they been raised; their family background; and whatever around them.
Cal & Mare; as much as I'm frustrated of how different attitudes of Cal and Mare are ( and we know they love each other! ) but they just didn't get along well about their politic thoughts. *love* bicker* *love* bicker* *ugh* BUT in other way; it's interesting for me to see how they insist on what they believe. ( Not like some Soup Opera 'Oh I love you; I will give up my revenge and choose to be with you' boo )
Cal is Silver; been born and raise like a Silver. Mare is new blood ( but her heart is Red ) Their issue and scene is just SO WHATTT?!?!????? (view spoiler) But I don't judge them. I don't think Cal or Mare is right or wrong. They always remind me of two sides ( in my society ) in politic days. Silver aka. Superior one & Red aka. Inferior one that's why I understand them both. *Except if I read this in politic days; I might be RAGEEEE at one of them here because I pick a side* Hahahaha but now no I like them both.
2. More MAVEN and his complicated character
Love this one of how it gave me many pages of Maven ( which is my favorite parts among all ). Gosh how I love his character. This boy is broken; complex; and interesting. We saw how he love Mare; have soft spots for her; BUT He is still wicked and cunning ( Not bad turns good in sudden just because of looovvve ) Whatever; He love her in his poisonous way & Their tension IS the BEST! Goshh His Love. Her Hatred. Just wrench my gut! My Heart bleed and I'm in pain.
So it comes to my complaint... ARE TWO BOYS LOVE HER NOT ENOUGH!!!!????? In Glass Sword; I remember I felt sorry so much for Killoin. and I pray; I PRAY that my favorite boy Maven will not love Mare like Killon does. Then I read King's Cage and what I got? Gosh He love her; love so much. His confession made my heart giddy and hurt cuz I'm afraid to know the end. As much as I'm happy at every scenes between Mare and Maven I read; but it still prickle my heart cuz I know in every breath that in Mare's heart; she hate him. She will never love him as loving his brother.
Stop. Just stop torturing my heart. Stop playing with my feelings. I don't know.. it's like Mare and Maven more get along together in term of their inner personality; but just because she think he is evil so she insists every bit in herself to not feel for him. Damn. It would be very interesting to see them as Silver King & Red Queen together.

King's Cage was the most powerful; deep and contradictory installment of Red Queen so far. The first half nearly drove me to give it three stars; it was unbearably slow and made me question my decision to continue this series many times. I felt like I was drowning in a swamp; trying to move yet stuck in the same place for so long I lost the concept of time. But in the end it seemed that the countless pages where nothing happened were necessary to understand the characters and set the foundations for the second half; which was undeniably mindblowing; full of epic fight sequences and moments to elate you only to shatter you minutes later.
â€œWe're not a god's chosen; but a god's cursed.â€
Mare spends six months imprisoned; tortured; living at the mercy of a wicked boy-king who keeps her in a cage because that is the only way she'll stay with him; who uses her to serve his own ends and each day steals a piece of her and replaces it with hopelessnes and anger; while the Scarlet Guard makes new allies and strives to end his reign of lies. With threats of civil war; rebelling houses claiming power and newbloods who shift the balance between Reds and Silvers; the kingdom of Norta will either be reformed or engulf in flames. For there is only one throne and two Calore sons; divided by betrayal; ambission; and a stubborn lightning girl.
â€œI am Mare Barrow. Not Mareena; not the lightning girl. Mare.â€
Who is Mare Barrow? A self-centered hypocrite. A murderer. A traitor. That's what I would have told you in the beginning of King's Cage. It is no secret that I am not particularly fond of Mare. In fact; a sadictic and rather cruel part of me enjoyed her tortures and her despair; all those moments when she finally felt the weight of her mistakes and rush decisions. Who are you to judge Cal ? I wanted to shout. How can you possibly blame him for not taking a stand after all the horror and injustice he has witnessed when the path you follow is paved with more blood and reverse discriminations in the name of common good? I wanted to peel off my skin every time she claimed she knew Maven so well; Maven of all people; an evil and broken boy who kept up with his atrocities even when his puppeteer was gone; while she never tried to see things from Cal's perspective. I still hate this self-righeous Mare. But thankfully; in King's Cage; she proved that she is more. And she somehow taught me that not a single character in this series is purely evil or purely good; the same way she learned it. I want you to remember this day; folks. The day I admitted that Mare Barrow became a tolerable and relatable heroine. I can't say the same about Maven; though. It is true that he wasn't born a monster; that his madness is the result of his horrible mother; and after his confessions he gained my understandment; but not my sympathy. Some choices were his. The slaughtered babies; the court manipulation; the power games; they were his. What he feels for Mare is not love; just a sick obsession. And I'm looking forward to his downfall.
â€œRed. Red as blood; red as fire. Red as the anger eating us both alive.â€
Tiberias Calore is not the flawless prince I thought he was.
And that revelation was not the result of Victoria Aveyard's efforts to twist his character to make readers love him less; like I believed at first. Don't get me wrong; he's still my favorite character; but I'm afraid I idolised him. The bitter truth is that he is not good at making decisions; like Maven; and Mare and Cameron and everyone else knew from the start. He is noble; and kind; and a great strategist; he loves Mare despite reason in a way that warms you up inside; but he has his weaknesses.
â€œChoose me.â€
I believe that what Victoria Aveyard tries to say in every sentence and every page is that power is alluring. A siren whose call no one can resist; regardless the colour of their blood; their rank and social status. And once you embrace power; and give in to its seductive touch and whispers of greatness; it taints you. And inevitably you lose something. Your humanity. Your kindness. Your soul. Your ideals. Your loved ones. Some things you can never get back. And I can't help but commend Victoria Aveyard for the way she delivers it. In King's Cage she masterfully delved into her characters' depths; she gave them multiple dimensions and made the reader invested in them; besides the intricate plot with the intrigue; the politics and the battle scenes that were undoubtedly epic. While my loyalties are still the same; I finished it more open-minded. And that's probably the reason the ending hurt me this much. In a way; when I read this series only for the plot was better. My feelings varied from annoyed to angry; and as soon as I finished each book I didn't think about it twice. But this time; it will haunt me. Because it has torn me apart.
â€œNow I'm in a king's cage. But so is he. My chains are Silent Stone. His is the crown.â€
On a brighter note; I cheered for Evangeline (who may or may not have been the biggest and scariest badass); I swooned over shirtless Cal and I experienced a rush of adrenaline each time a fight was described or a new conspiracy was set into motion. If it hadn't been for the first half; King's Cage would deserve all the stars in the sky!

Mare; Iâ€™d argue; is the central character who let this series down. Not just how insufferable she is but how Aveyard scrambled to reassign the ethnicity of the character halfway through the series â€“ in one of the most shameful acts of commercialistic tokenism Iâ€™ve pretty much ever heard of. Iâ€™ve noticed that trend a lot lately; YA authors wanting to be heralded and championed by their readers as inclusive and diverse â€”*cough* Carve The Mark *cough*cough* â€” so they think; Iâ€™ll toss a black person in it as a main character. Yeah. Thatâ€™ll totally do it. When confronted about the fact Mareâ€™s sister; Gisa; is white; Aveyardâ€™s uninventive response was that she was white but Mare was dark-skinned becauseâ€¦ geneticsâ€”BOOM! And OK; yeah; it could happen between siblings but on the most unrealistic genetic odds; odds that someone; who is supposed to be a screenwriter in the age of the cynical movie-goer; would have to know that no one is EVER going to buy that excuse. You can just see a movie audience over on Rotten Tomatoes doing an eye-roll as I speak.
In a post Oscars so White world that excuse is just so lame that it doesnâ€™t even warrant a response; so Iâ€™m quickly going to disprove what Aveyard is saying by Book Trailer 1 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UbsN...) and Book Trailer 2 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeR_...). Youâ€™ll notice in these trailers both the actors playing Mare are white; which doesnâ€™t make sense as Epic Reads is owned by Aveyardâ€™s publisher; they would have had firsthand knowledge and contact with Victoria about Mareâ€™s ethnicity. And with the number of times sheâ€™s appeared on their segments; she hasnâ€™t raised anything about the trailers being racially inaccurate with anyone. Now Mareâ€™s skin is always self-consciously talked about at pretty much every possible occurrence in Glass Sword and Kingâ€™s Cage. I can just picture Aveyard hammering at her keypad going: I HAVE HISPANIC CHARACTER. UNIVERSAL STUDIOS!!!!
And here is where our problem lies. Commercialistic tokenism. Honestly; one author I give props to is Cassandra Clare. (Give me a sec to explain.) I donâ€™t really like her writing at all but her characters and their sexualities and nationalities were always unashamedly out in the open and organic; woven into the DNA of the characters. (Not an afterthought.) Iâ€™ve asked myself this question a lot; the question that if they show a person of colour isnâ€™t that good on its own merit no matter how crap it is or how manipulative that is? Iâ€™m going to say at least they tried. But it still annoys me that characters of colour written by people of colour are more often than not hidden behind the bookshelves of characters of colour written by white women. And the idea of Mare in a movie studio that I love just gives me chills â€“ if you thought Bellaâ€™s dialogue was bad wait until you get a load of the way Mare speaks.
And the f/f relationship. What an effrontery to us lesbian women everywhere that was. It felt forced; stunted; plastic. Aveyard appeared on numerous sites toting the fact that she had a lesbian relationship; specifically to draw attention and enumerate the fact. And this draws me to the reason why Iâ€™ve increasingly become adrift to YA authorâ€™s charm of late; who feel that every act of including someone different then they are; someone who is not white; someone who is not straight; is cause for a celebration; a congratulatory pat on the back. They pause when they announce stuff like that; as if theyâ€™re expecting adoring applause to drown out the noise around them. I feel more like Iâ€™ve been checking my watch; tapping my foot impatiently for YA authors to arrive at the party with the rest of us literati; and now theyâ€™re here Iâ€™m forced to pretend that I enjoy their company. Now theyâ€™re acting like the life of the party despite the fact that itâ€™s two hours late; weâ€™ve all gotten seriously drunk and eaten all the food; weâ€™re getting our coats on â€“ and are walking out the door.
This series; like its botch attempt to complete the laborious chores of being â€œdiverseâ€; is an afterthought. (less)",339,NEXTBOOK

After one semi-intelligible novel in Red Queen and one genuine flop in Glass Sword; Kingâ€™s Cage was going to be 26-year-old Victoria Aveyardâ€™s Hail Mary on the series that was supposed to be the â€œnext big YA thingâ€ but has been a painful lesson in hype versus realistic expectation. Does it succeed in doing so: I so badly wanted to say she turned things around but she didnâ€™t â€“ and thatâ€™s putting it nicely.
Hereâ€™s the thing that Iâ€™m still wondering about with Victoria Aveyard â€“ how did things go so wrong for her? I mean; she had it all: HarperTeen and Epic Reads carefully controlled the reviews of the book by pre-leasing copies to targeted BookTubers whose opinion they could count on to be positive; the marketing campaign; if anything; was maybe too aggressive; with people hyping up Red Queen all over the place â€“ on Twitter; Facebook; Instagram â€“ and calling it the next Hunger Games; Divergent; Selection; and that everyone should buy it.
And we were like â€“ Sure Thing Entitled White People! We Believe You!
I canâ€™t remember a release as advertising-intense as this since Divergent was out and it worked that time round so then how; exactly; did it all torpedo in Aveyardâ€™s face and not turn her into the Suzanne Collins success she was constructed to be by her publisher? The odds were in her favour. She had plenty of high-powered connections; she breezed casually straight to a publishing and movie deal with barely any effort at all; she had it all. BookTuber reviews are pretty good at swaying public opinion and masking any problems of a book by pillowing the internet with praise; so I never expected to see 1 star and 2 star reviews piling up on the main comments page.
Soâ€¦ what the hell happened?
I can chalk up to only a few things. The first; Veronica Roth entered the scene with the very first Hunger Games-inspired book and by the time Victoria Aveyard published that door had clearly and loudly shut. The second; Aveyard accidentally compared her work to be on par with Game of Thrones; an act in itself which is just setting yourself up for failure because then people are automatically disappointed when itâ€™s nowhere even close. Beyond that; I think people are just tired of reading Game of Thrones and Hunger Games knock-offs no matter how good the publicity departments claim they are. I think YA publishing is finally starting to come out of its coma and realise that they have GOT TO STOP pushing the same derivative plot before we all tear our eyes out.
And finally; Victoria is kind ofâ€¦ elitistâ€¦ Thereâ€™s a line between being proud and being stuck-up and I think Aveyard crossed that line without meaning to. And in a world that is becoming incredibly impossible to separate the artist from the art; Aveyard tends to come across as elitist. Next to the release of Red Queen Aveyard released an article on her blog (http://victoriaaveyard.blogspot.com.a...) that didnâ€™t really help that image.
But her personality really became even more apparent when she started lashing out to critics on Goodreads and caused probably the biggest awkward silence in book reviewer history.
To be honest; I gave her a pass on that one because she was new and I can understand people lashing out on what people say on goodreads. But she has to understand that criticism is a part of being in the entertainment industry and I can tell you for a fact that most of the reviews on goodreads are tame in comparison to whatâ€™s out there.
If you canâ€™t handle what people say on goodreads and youâ€™re a writer then man youâ€™re in the wrong industry because there are going to be people that say things much worse in the future. You shouldnâ€™t be lashing out at these people. You should be using goodreads as a practice ground. Plus a lot of criticisms from people â€“ who werenâ€™t paid by HarperTeen to give it five or four stars â€“ are pretty valid; and if Aveyard had listen to one or two of their comments I feel this series really could have been pulled up from its death-spiral. In response to a lot of fair criticism; Aveyard just doubled-down and placed the blame on piracy; ARCS; and 1 star rogue reviewers which is insane because on average five star reviews outnumber 1 star reviews about 60; 000 to one.
Some people were supposed to hate it because art is supposed to be subjective. Itâ€™s only worth making when thereâ€™s a plurality of opinions; good and bad. And it is possible that itâ€™s not quite as good as you think it is: Harper Collins is not known for having the most on-the-job editorial staff. (Check out the Continent by Kiera Drake scandal if you donâ€™t believe me.)
Iâ€™m currently completing my BFA at USC as well and just for clarity â€“ Iâ€™m a woman â€“ and I cannot stand it when girl screenwriters in my class go; â€œMale writers canâ€™t write women.â€ And my response was; â€œThatâ€™s funny the last script you turned in the lead character had sex with the chiselled ripped-up doctor by page three and just talked about it all the way after. Meanwhile the black guy over there had his female black lesbian throw a guy through a window on page 1.â€
I have a feeling Aveyard probably belongs to that clique of writers that believe because a man wrote it it should be set on fire. Sheâ€™s constantly bashing actors like Tom Hanks and other male screenwriters. (Donâ€™t get this one: The thing is; sheâ€™s a screenwriter as well; someone who wants to work in Hollywood. Did; like; no one tell her that pissing off one of the big-name actors or people she could get a job from was; like; I donâ€™t know â€“ a good way to never eat a hot meal ever again?)
There seems to be this growing fury and vindictive agenda of women writers pitting themselves against male writers; especially if the men catch a break. Why do that to people who donâ€™t know you and have no idea who you are and have worked probably just as hard for their big break? If there are showrunners like Shonda Rhimes then thereâ€™s no excuse why no one else can be like her. And FYI; maybe thereâ€™d be more things like female producers and directors if they didnâ€™t keep immaturely dropping out of Hollywood over â€œcreative differencesâ€.
Not to mention Kathleen Kennedyâ€™s New York Timeâ€™s article a few months back that Star Wars doesnâ€™t owe men anything; which is just a cruel thing to sayâ€”why does one groupâ€™s success hinge on another groupâ€™s complete eradication and extinction? One of my favourite movie critics; Grace Randolph; made a very insightful and thorough video here if youâ€™d like to see it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16OOg... .
I totally believe in sexism in the film industry but heckling people over Twitter who have gone further into the movie industry than you doesnâ€™t really do much to fix the problem. If you want to change it you have to be productive. Work towards your own success. Write the stories you want to see and hire the people you want to see. Donâ€™t knock male writers who have worked just as hard as you and perhaps harder to get their big break in the screenwriting business just because theyâ€™re men.
Just had to throw that out of the way before I got into the review.
Whew! Time to get in to the novel.
I didnâ€™t realise I drifted so far off topic.
Sorry my peeps!
My major problem with this series is its glaring inconsistency. I think Aveyard is probably much suited to television than she is to blockbusters; because though she easily getâ€™s that whole laying down the track for an oncoming train element of TV writing; this same ability really destroys any cohesiveness of her novel; where she manipulates time and events on the fly to suit her writing.
There are moments where you feel sheâ€™s changed the entire behaviour; attitude; and abilities of a character to service the plot and her endgame. For instance; in this book she says Mare was uneducated and how that lack of education is what keeps the Reds down in the dust; but in the first book when Shade sent a letter to her family she was the one who read it aloud.
And like Sarah J. Mass; Aveyard suffers profusely from what I call â€œQuotablity Syndromeâ€. With Sarah J. Mass I think itâ€™s probably because sheâ€™s accustomed to fan-fiction (sometimes fan-fiction authors are hit and miss); but with Aveyard I think her problem originates with imagining every scene spoken aloud in the teaser trailer for the movie that Universal Studios has not even talked about. By that I mean that she is constantly focused on ensuring the words and passages sound euphonic; rather really understanding what sheâ€™s saying or taking a step back and realizing how dumb her character looks saying it. Itâ€™s whatâ€™s made Mare insufferable in both books. Here are some of my favourites from the past two books if you donâ€™t believe me:
Glass Sword:
If I am a sword; I am a sword made of glass; and I feel myself beginning to shatter.
Anyone; anything; can betray anyone. Even your own heart.
And the romance:
This is always a huge problem for female writers. I see this all the time in class and when screenwriters and authors get defensive. They go: How dare you ship my characters the novel isnâ€™t about romance! That is so sexist! And then Iâ€™m like: Dude; if you didnâ€™t want shipping to happen then why did you have the main character make out with both the brothers? Unless you suffer from amnesia or are slightly unconscious at the helm of your laptop; you wrote that love triangle into the book Aveyard and itâ€™s too late to change it now. If you didnâ€™t want it to be about romance then donâ€™t have them kiss. Have Mare be asexual or something! Donâ€™t even bring it up! Make the brothers totally unattractive or that sheâ€™s too distracted with her situation; but when Mare spends every couple of pages tripping over these boys Mary Sue-style donâ€™t expect people to not have readers ask you about the romance! You put it in your bloody book! I can see she was trying to make the novel like Reign from the CW; but it backfired and for some reason sheâ€™s not interested in it anymore. A pure sign of ill-plotting on her part. To be fair; Aveyardâ€™s not alone. Female writers always trip themselves up on the romance. I think itâ€™s just a habit. One that Aveyard is yet to break.
My feelings on Mare: ...I got nothing...
What I imagine must be that poor rebellionâ€™s feelings on Mare at this point in the story and we're pretty much on the same page:
Yes. We get it already. You're imprisoned. After reading most of Aveyardâ€™s oeuvre I wasnâ€™t surprised to find that Mare continued being her hundred-watt-Mary-Sue old self. Aveyard has mechanized her to whine and complain every few pages; and say she is a bad-ass despite there being an enormous lack of evidence to support that theory.
Lastly; the plagiarism. Ah. This is a weird one. Iâ€™ve seen tonnes of more reviewers on Goodreads; of late; start to actually call authors out on it; which is great to finally start seeing. I think that to call something inspired instead of plagiarised is just changing the label to something more socially acceptable but itâ€™s essentially the same thing. To be clear; Aveyard's work is not a heavy amalgamation of research and historical elements deftly woven into a fantasy threat like Martin's work.
If that was the case then I wouldn't have had a problem but there were some serious moments where I felt that it was a very narrow margin between plagiarism and not-plagiarism. I was surprised to see people finally call Veronica Roth out on it since sheâ€™s been pretty much immune her whole career. In Aveyardâ€™s case; I think the plagiarism is pretty baseless; to me itâ€™s not really plagiarism but rather really thick imitation of two novels: The Hunger Games and Game of Thrones; which are all heavily embedded in her workâ€”more like plastered all overâ€”but in the kind of way that leads you to believe she thought she could make a shit tonne of money if she only changed stuff slightly around and fed it into a book about teenagers.
I think it's sad because this act alone really destroys books when you write by someone else's voice and imagination. In class they gave us this quote that I kept thinking about:
And it's true in this day and age originality sells above all else because people are tired of the same circulating plot which is why I think I just couldn't plug into King's Cage. With King's Cage; it just can't escape the gravity of its creative influences - unlike so many other books that can take the same idea but steer it down a whole different alleyway of implications.
There were just too many uncomfortably close moments where I was thinking to myself; That reminds me of something. And it wasn't just this novel but in Glass Sword there was the very glaring Peeta and Katniss bread reference with the coin where my jaw literally hit the floorâ€”was she honestly stealing that scene from the Hunger Games. I meanâ€¦really! Really! What is YA these days; fan-fiction? [Scene: I remember the burdened boy who gave me a silver coin when I was nothing. With that one gesture he changed my future; and destroyed his own.] I think I just canâ€™t forgive any more YA authors that steal work from the Hunger Games because Iâ€™m just fed up. Can people at least steal passages from a franchise I donâ€™t read every Christmas? It's ""not plagiarism"" exactly; but it's not ""originality"" either; which makes it just awkward for me because I can't help think on some sort of spectrum that it's not entirely ""the right thing"" either.
I think this series is pretty dead in the water. Aveyard might have started off aiming high but itâ€™s sunk to gliding; passionless mediocrity at this point. Itâ€™s lost a lot of its original WOW-factor. Whatâ€™s sad about this series is what Iâ€™m finding sad about a lot of YA books these days. Good idea but poor execution and bad characters. This book; in my view; could have easily have scored a movie deal back before it was published but now I can understand why they never greenlit. First impressions are everything these days and Mare has just done too much damage to doctor at this point; and based on its sales itâ€™s doing nowhere near the numbers to power a box office solely on its brand power.
You might have heard that the movie is being made. To be clear: the movie is â€IN DEVELOPMENTâ€™ which means that Aveyard is trying to channel as much buzz as she can by telling everyone they are making it. But with there having been no news in almost three years; Universalâ€™s packed slate with Fast and Furious 8; Jurassic World 2; and a plethora of other movies lined up; I think Universal has probably passed by now. After all; Universal is one of the few companies that can challenge Disney for a seat in the billion dollar club; and I donâ€™t see them jeopardising their outstanding reputation for a YA novel when book adaptations have shown to be pretty financially unsuccessful these days (just look at how the Divergent series died â€“ and Aveyard is repped by the same literary agency that reps Veronica Roth so thereâ€™s probably that conflict of interest for the studio execs).
Can this series be saved? I honestly don't know why but I'm going to pray that the 4th book is the charm here and keep my fingers crossed. Even if this series has bombed I'll be interested to see what projects Aveyard starts in the future.

Wellâ€¦
No one can possibly understand how much love and adoration I have for this series. Book one and two were literal obsessions for me. I loved them so deeply that I literally took the time to annoy each and every one of my closest friends who chose to give a shitâ€¦even though 4/5 of them didnâ€™t care for this series. I canâ€™t even count all the times throughout a year that I say the name â€Calâ€™. I know for a fact that I induced many an eyeroll from everyone around me. All year long it was Cal this; Cal that; epic ending this; epic ending thatâ€¦.it was unforgettable; if only to me. This was my world; and I longed for it every moment I couldnâ€™t have it. And thenâ€¦this.
Itâ€™s almost comical. Every step I take explodes in my face. I tried to save Kilorn from conscription and maimed my sister instead. I became a maid to help my family and within hours became a prisoner. I believed Mavenâ€™s words and Mavenâ€™s false heart. I trusted Cal to choose me. I raided a prison to free people and ended up clutching Shadeâ€™s corpse. I sacrificed myself to save the people I love. I gave Maven a weapon. And now; try as I might to thwart his reign from the inside; I think Iâ€™ve done something much worse.
Look; Iâ€™m clearly the weak link here. You can go to the bookâ€™s page and clearly see that the four and five star reviews are just rollllling in. And what the funniest thing to me is; where the hell were these reviews for book one and two? When I needed someone to fangirl with; when I just needed a fix; a quick look at a new perspective from someone who truly loved this series as much as me-where the hell were these amazing; glowing reviews? There was so much hate for the first two books that; okay; yes; were a bit cliche and a bit over the top; and even were a bit repetitive with the phrase â€lightening girlâ€™; and now people like this one? Okayâ€¦that last one was said A LOT; but still. My point is this: there was no more wrong with those two books than this book; yet the praise keeps rolling in for KC. In fact; I really wonder what made this such a success in so many peopleâ€™s minds?
Like I said in my pre-post after just finishing-Its not about the teams and its certainly not about who she will ultimately chooseâ€¦or not choose. I just think there was so much potential for this story and it fell so so flat.
The smell of smoke gets stronger as I push on. Hope flares. Where thereâ€™s smoke; thereâ€™s a fire prince.
Let me start with my least favorite part of this whole book and what I had thought was a shoe in for being my favorite: The extra POV. I meanâ€¦.what. The fuck. WAS that?? Cameron was not only a character that I hated more than I could ever POSSIBLY have hated Mare; but she was an absolute brat. She was grouchy. She was judgmental. And; what do I care what anyone thinks; Iâ€™m just going to say it: She did nothing but talk shit about Cal. FINE. Itâ€™s fine-And believe me when I say that if this was the only problem I had with this book; I would have GLADLY handed this book yet another five-I love this series SO MUCH that Iâ€™d have wholeheartedly dealt with the self-righteous and obnoxious Cameron (to this I ask reviewers why they love Cameron so much? You all have hated Mare so muchâ€¦yet Cameron is just Mare on crack. She calls Cal and others outâ€¦but she might be just as bad; if not worse; than Mare. Soâ€¦why?) with a smile on my face. No. Believe me when I say there are far more problems than something as simple as my bias.
Nights spent curled against Cal. Forcing Cameron to join our cause. Stolen moments rereading Mavenâ€™s sickening notes. Memories of who I thought the forgotten prince was. My cowardice. My nightmares. My mistakes. Every selfish step I took that led me here.
Look what you did. Look what you did. Look what you did.
For oneâ€¦.Iâ€™ve read a million and one books that are bridges to the final story; and not felt an ounce of the boredom I felt for this one. Itâ€™s just a whole lot of nothing; if Iâ€™m being honest. I suppose there was plenty of political planning; war strike planning; and even some pretty decent action scenes; but it felt so contrived; so forced that I couldnâ€™t help but feel wholly disconnected.
Which is my next problem: Do you ever feel like youâ€™re an outsider looking in? I mean; in a way; arenâ€™t books kind of supposed to be like that? Of course we are merely the readers; simply observing our favorite characters from outside the book; rooting them on and hoping they make it out alive? Well; yes; in a way this is correct. But; if you really think about it; how often do you ACTUALLY feel this way? The answer should be never. You should never feel separated from your characters; you should always be so fully immersed in the world that you canâ€™t tell where your fictitious book world ends and real life begins. Thereâ€™s a fine line here you donâ€™t want to cross; and it happened here. Not once in this series have I ever felt like the twice-removed cousin hanging out like a creeper in the backâ€¦but this book made me feel so left out; so apart from the story; that when I finally got to the part I pined for; I just couldnâ€™t fall back into the story. In fact; when that moment hit? I deflated like a balloon. I knew for a fact I wasnâ€™t going to love this story; no matter how much went my way. And; believe me; a ton did; all the way up to a twisted; fucked up ending. I justâ€¦simply ceased to love; to care. And this might be why my heart is still completely shattered.
Even now; when I am painfully his; he wonâ€™t let go. I would prefer death to this cage; to the twisted obsession of a mad boy king.
And; sigh; the elephant in the room; on my end: Maven. If you look back at my reviews; you can see I have never hated Maven. Sure; he has been an obstacle between Cal and Mare; and this brings out the competitive juices in me. But never has there been utter hate. I even liked Maven in book one-not as her love interest; but as a person. He was never a true problem for me because; in the end; I loved Cal so deeply that the Maven moments were inconsequential. So; when I heard this was mostly a Maven driven book; it didnâ€™t deter me in the least. Who cares?? But I did feel that there was something icky about how he was handled. We all know heâ€™s not truly a monster. Heâ€™s a wounded boy who grew up with odd circumstances and a repulsive mother. But we also know Victoria Aveyardâ€™s intention is not for Maven to be a love interest-she has made this more than clear. So then...why all the Maven empathy? Isnâ€™t it kind of fruitless after 30% to continue laying on the Maven mind games? He loves Mare in the only way he canâ€¦but even Mare can see a screw is loose. So I guess I just felt like it was cruel to Maven fans; honestly. Which is something I never thought Iâ€™d say.
I wonder if he has nightmares of the assassination attempt. Nightmares of his mother; dead by my hand. His father; dead by his action. His brother; in exile but a constant threat. Funny; Maven called himself Calâ€™s shadow; but Cal is the shadow now; haunting every corner of Mavenâ€™s fragile kingdom.
Sigh. And Mare. Oh Mare-she can make or break your love for this seriesâ€¦.where I sit wholeheartedly in the middle. She definitely isnâ€™t someone Iâ€™d say is a favorite heroine (or even one I truly like) but I donâ€™t feel the way most readers do. She is kind of a badass; really. And yes; she has made me so mad I could throw my iPad across the room; but no; she isnâ€™t unbearable; to me. She was the best sheâ€™s ever been-I can assure everyone of that. I wonâ€™t get into it; but I will say this: my biggest problem is what COULD be. I donâ€™t know how Aveyard will end thisâ€¦but I do have a problem with one outcome; and Iâ€™ll leave it alone because I; quite frankly; donâ€™t want to be harassed about it. Just know; there is a superâ€¦depressing way this could end; and I sure hope she doesnâ€™t choose to end it that way; because it would really break my heart.
â€œIf your heartâ€™s not in this; youâ€™re going to get a lot of people killed.â€
He whirls; almost knocking me on my ass with the speed and force of his movement. I have seen his fire firsthand; but never so strongly as the flame blazing in his eyes.
â€œCameron; my heart is quite literally in this;â€ he hisses through gritted teeth.
And Iâ€™ll make my normally longer than life paragraph about Cal short and sweet. He had some extremely swoony; wonderful; amazing quotes and moments in this book-some that I could only dream of actually happening-I was beyond ecstatic. His love for Mare (and actual declaration of it) made my soul soar and I was on cloud nineâ€¦but only to an extent. Thatâ€™s as far as it went because of that â€feeling like an outsiderâ€™ deal I mentioned earlier. I could only immerse myself so farâ€¦and that might have been the final nail in the coffin; for me: My darling baby Cal feeling like the shell of the man he could be. Justâ€¦.OUCH.
So; I guess thatâ€™s that. A lot of ramble; but a whole lot of deep truths from me. I can only be truthful and I can only say what I feel-thereâ€™s no room for half-truths or false pleasantries. I liked a few things about this book but; in the end; I just wanted and needed more. Evangeline was a definite plus in this book; seeing as Iâ€™ve always liked her from afar (and now I adore her); but not enough to save the breaks in this story and my expectations. Iâ€™m glad people are loving thisâ€¦.Iâ€™m just devastated Iâ€™m not one of them.
â€œThen what do you want?â€ When Kilorn asked me that same question; it gave me focus; purpose; a clear path in darkness. â€œWhat do you want; Cal?â€
He answers quickly; eyes blazing. â€œYou.â€ His fingers tighten on mine; hot but steady in temperature. Heâ€™s holding himself back as much as he can. â€œI am in love with you; and I want you more than anything else in the world.â€
I hope even Victoria can read this review and understand I have no ill intent-I will forever be a huge fan of this series and I STILL love book one and two way more than is acceptable for my health. It is never my intention to attack an author; to attack other peopleâ€™s opinions-I simply have to get my thoughts out; for my voice to be heard by those who care enough to hear it. I think Iâ€™ve always been a fair reviewer; and I hope people can see that the only thing Iâ€™m trying to say in my review is this: Iâ€™m just a girl who is obsessed with this series; and my heart and soul hurt because I couldnâ€™t find a connection with this story; whatever the reason. It hurts me more than it hurts anyone reading this; and I have nothing but hope for an amazing final book. And if not?? Iâ€™ll forever adore the first two books and they will always be in a prime spot on my nerdy bookshelf/shrine in our living room. I just hope people can see that-I give up on series for way less than thisâ€¦yet here I sit; ready for book four and hoping for all the best. I just hope my heart doesnâ€™t get ripped in two next year. I guess weâ€™ll see; wonâ€™t we?

**************************
NO one knows how painful this is for me to rate and feel this way. It has nothing to do with Maven. It has nothing to do with my precious baby Cal; who; by the way; I will still marry someday and who can STILL do no wrong in my eyes. And; actually; it has nothing to do with Mare. I don't care if you're team Cal; Maven; Mare; Kilorn; or Evangeline. In fact? It had nothing to do with this hideous representation of the characters in this story; at all.
What it comes down to? This story sucked; plain and simple. Boring without an ounce of inspiration; this book is nothing more than filler; extra drama; and a total bridge to the final book. And; if I'm being completely honest; I; for once; don't see how the next book can be any better.
I'll hold out hope; though. Cal is a number one BBF; and I will see this all the way to the end.

So guys this was one of my favourite series but this book just made me so upset. I hate it!!!! I feel to laugh in Mare's face at the end. Bitch. I am so happy that that happened! I think that's one of the only positives. Oh and these are just my taught and opinions ;)
So I finally decided to do a proper review.
I gave this book 2*. I won't lie the first half was enjoyable. The sarcasm was on point and I loved the whole weird feelings and relationship between Mare and Maven. It was interesting and reminded me so much of Unravel Me that it just broke my heart.
The whole plot with Cameron and Cal and crew was just a yawn fest for me.
However I finally realised what people mean about Mare. My eyes was finally open to see how she is a self centered bitch. Everything must revolve around her or else she will find a way for the plot to become so. For example Maven stayed away from Mare for like about a month and because she was bored and felt as if he was not paying her any attention she made it her duty to get his attention. Its ridiculous. Why does the author goad on readers in a certain direction and just totally do the opposite by the end of the book? Why give me hope? I can understand if you don't fool readers and tell them about one thing but then and stick with that. Then there is no reason to get angry. But when you make me feel one way and then just snatch it away???? Just for fan reaction I get angry and pissed.
Anyway so the plot pretty much was non existent. You can skip this one really and go on to book 4.
Surprisingly I liked Cal better in this book than the last. I totally understand why he did what he did. Once again Mare cough*ass* tries to make him feel bad. Cal is so much more than the author makes him out to be. He reminds ma a bit of Chaol though.
I just have a bad feeling that Maven will die in the next book. I hope not. I really do. At this point I can just read an entire book from his perspective. My heart broke for him in this book. Such a strong character. I feel so sorry for him. Why can't Maven just be happy and get a good ending? Is it too much to ask????? Maven is a character who needs time and his character needs to be fleshed out properly so that he can be understood and not misread.Come on Victoria. You can do better. (view spoiler) Gonna say this now: if book 4 turns out the way i hope then i will totally try to look pass the sheer stupidity of this one. Anyway let me stop my rambling for now. May or may not read the last book.
Edit.
For the Mare & Maven shippers
(view spoiler)
Edit (taught before reading)
my link text. Guys the books trailer!!!!!!Maven!!!!!!Aggggggggghhhhhbfhskkd
Lets remind ourselves of how sexy Maven is!
The shadow of the flame. He is certainly ablaze; but darkness eats at his edges. Bruise-like splotches of black and blue surround eyes bloodshot with silver veins. He has not slept. Heâ€™s thinner than I remember; leaner; crueler. His hair; black as a void; has reached his ears; curling at the ends; and his cheeks are still smooth.
Maven!!!
Edit
Guys! Tomorrow!!! Despite what happens that's that. I am going into it with low expectations; because when I go in in the highs everything is just awful if I expect too much and that has happened a lot especially with Throne of Glass series for me. Good luck everyone!
I need the time to sapped up to Feb 7th! I don't think I can wait any longer! The suspense is killing me!!!!!
Update
A snippet
Knowing it's what he wants to see; I let the tears of frustration overwhelm and fall. He tracks their paths with hunger
I know Maven still has feelings for Mare.
Edit
It has a cover!!!! And its a crown made of BONES!!!!!
A bag of mysteries; this book!!!
All Will Burn...
Edit
Title!!!!! We have a title KING'S CAGE!!!!
No no. No no!!!!!
This. Can't . Be!!!!!!
I need my Mavey ship to sail!!!

This.
Book.
Sucked.
ASS!
You guys have been warned. By the end of this book; you'll be spitting out needles and hot lava.
This ""breathless third installment"" kept up to it's word. Oh; yes; it certainly left me breathless.
BREATHLESS FROM SPITTING OUT NEEDLES AND HOT LAVA!
Wow; Aveyard; you spin up this wonderful tale about lies; hurt; betrayal; love; affection; and you give me this SHITTY book?!
Where's the suspense; may I ask? Where's the drama; the action; the fire? The LOVE?!
This is already the third fricking book in the series; and Cal and Mare are still prancing around each other like sick; mutant bunnies!!
Worthless; I say! This book took up so much time; effort; and energy. There's a reason why I borrowed this book from the library. And no; it's not because I'm broke from buying too much candy and snacks.
No! It's because the second book already failed me; and this book was no better.
This entire thing was full of words and no play! And you know? 528 pages is a LOT of boring shit to read!
You happy; Aveyard?
Could I also add in the fact that the characters were as boring as the dirt under their fingernails?
I told you.......worthless. Mare has already gathered up a few members to add to the army. Yet; she sits in a crusty ass dungeon after being captured. Does she do anything to get out? NO!
They talked about war for the past two books!
What do the readers expect? WAR.
But there is NOTHING going on. They train and train; for endless hours; plan and talk for endless hours. To prepare them for what?! It's already been two books. A thousand pages and weeks of reading!

WARNING! This review will contain spoilers. I will first talk about non-spoiler stuff then I'll switch to a spoiler chat. If you have not read King's Cage; then don't continue. Or if you don't have any intention on reading the Red Queen series; then welcome.
To say I was disappointed would be correct.
To say that I was glad I was done reading King's Cage would also be correct.
EpicReads (who I like) overhyped the hell out of this series. It's not the best series ever; but it isn't bad. The Red Queen series is just a mixture of every YA dystopia/fantasy ever. The series isn't something new. Not to mention how several people are saying Victoria ripped off Red Rising by Pierce Brown. (Darrow. Mare Barrow. Caste system by color. Royalty; etc.) So the series isn't something to write home about. But it's entertaining. But boy this series is pretty... meh.
There's also been controversy about Mare's ethnicity and skin color. In the book trailers; the actress who portrays Mare is white. Also; there wasn't a clear description of Mare in Red Queen. So I; and I'm sure a lot of people; thought Mare was white. Later; in the second book; Victora wrote Mare as being olive skinned. And cue the controversy. This was a problem to people for two reasons.
1) Mare's sister; Gisa. Gisa has red hair. I'm not a genetics expert so don't take my word as 100% accurate; but if Mare is olive skinned; how does Gisa have red hair if red hair isn't common in olive skinned people or of darker colors? Victoria said something about genetics which; like I said; I'm not a genetics expert (not to mention there isn't a clear description of Mare's parents' skin tones); so I'm not sure how this works.
2) There have been people accusing Victoria of commercial tokenism. (I just want to say upfront that I am not accusing Victoria as this. If she had Mare olive skinned from the beginning; then Mare is olive skinned.) When it comes to authors writing characters of different ethnicities; sexual orientation; and skin color; it comes naturally because... people like them exist. It's organic and feels natural. Victoria on the other hand never said what Mare REALLY looked like in the first book. And in book 2 and 3; her skin color is described better (Even though based on the book trailers; the actress was white). Of course; it's been a year since I've read book 1 and I might have missed something. It's great to have POC. This is the opinion of some people; not mine. Though Victoria didn't do a good job of properly explaining this whole fiasco. Not looking good for you; Victoria.
Enough about that; onto the review!
This is definitely the weakest book out of the series so far. And who knows how the last book will end. There were times where I was bored reading about Mare and... well; mainly bored in general. This book is all just filler; descriptions; and dialogue with little action spread out. I hate books like that. But before I talk about King's Cage; let me give you a run-down.
So Mare (if you Google Mare; it means a female horse. A horse. Smooth one; Victoria) has been captured by Maven and is a prisoner in his palace. Mare is incapable of using her powers and is trapped. She must find a way to escape in order to tell the Scarlet Guard what Maven is planning on doing.
As interesting at the premise is; the book failed to capture my attention as well as having little to no character development for Mare. Literally; the first 2/3rds of the book was filler and the last bit was rushed action. Aside from that; nothing else happened. Just talking and talking and talking and descriptions and more talking and more talking and *snore*
Based on the premise alone; this book was mainly political with a few talks of war tactics in it. That's all fine and dandy; but it was BORING!!!
Look; I've read the Winner's trilogy and that was a politically based series and I liked it. The plot kept me invested and the character growth and development helped keep me interested. King's Cage failed on all aspects of being a politically based book. All we got was Mare being a cry-baby; feeling sorry for herself and very little action.
I kid you not; 70% of the story is filler and the 30% is actual plot/action. There has to be an even balance between the two. The Winner's trilogy did that well. Not King's Cage.
Luckily; Cameron and another character saved the book. Cameron is without a doubt my favorite character in the series. I love her personality and her snarky attitude. She is probably the only character who sees how big of a mess the Scarlet Guard is and is not afraid to say it. She's blunt and I love it! The other character; I was surprised we got to see from her perspective. I wasn't expecting that. I can see how she may not be a favorite character to others; but I love how Cameron says things how they are. No sugarcoating; no holding back.
In this book; we get three POVs. Mare; Cameron; and... someone. (Trying to keep this part spoiler-free as much as possible.) I'm half and half about this format. Half of me liked it because I didn't have to read from Mare's POV as often (not to mention I get to read from Cameron's POV). But on the otherhand; I didn't see how this helped. Parts of it felt like chunks of the story was left out. Plus; the majority of it was Mare's POV. Which... ugh. I get that with these three characters; they offer insight on what each one is doing and what they're doing; but it didn't do a good job at it sometimes.
Though this may be simple and small; I have to say it. Victoria is not good with naming people; cities; and countries. There's a map in the book and the name of the cities are not good. Like Victoria just jumbled up some words to make them seem like a fantasy name and went with it. Nevermind that some names are lazy.
Now; let's get to the nitty gritty and talk about the book and characters.
WARNING! WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! WARNING! WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!
Mare.
Fucking Mare Barrow.
(Yes; I will refer to her as a horse from now on.)
I don't when know where to begin with this shit of a character. This annoying; whining; self-absorbed pathetic excuse of a character.
Mare really got on my nerves sometimes. She is by far; the worst character I have ever encountered in a book/series. Victoria tries to write her as this brave and powerful girl who is the face of a rebellion when in reality; she is a self-centered; whiny; bratty horse. You couldn't have picked a better name; Victoria??? Half of the time; Mare was being whiny and the other half she is stubborn and annoying. She also has a habit of breaking fine china. When she get's rescued about the last 1/3rd of the book; she didn't change much either. She was happy and had sex with Cal in the rain. And then; in the end; she was too angry to rationalize her feelings for Cal because he needs to be the king of Norata and overthrow Maven. Instead of being all understanding; she's pissed. Grow the fuck up; Mare and please kindly fuck off.
It annoys me how she is this special snowflake of a character. There are other people out there who can manipulate lightning but she's the strongest one??? I hate it when characters appoint someone the face of a rebellion just because their power is either strong or they are different. Mare isn't the face of a rebellion. She doesn't even deserve that rank.
Cal A.K.A Emo McBroody.
Cal is another character I was disappointed in. Which is sad because I liked him in Glass Sword. In King's Cage; Cal was being Emo McBroody and that did not help him with his development. Emo McBroody over here was pining for Mare (why I have no idea?) and was struggling with his allegiance to the Scarlet Guard and the Silvers. Look; Cal; I understand this is a hard time for you; but you are fighting in a war. Get over it. I feel like his character wasn't given justice because he was hardly seen during the first part of the book.
Cameron.
She is hands down; the best character ever! She was the only character I was rooting for. She had one goal and one goal in mind: rescue his brother. When she did; I thought she would be leaving the Scarlet Guard. Even though she didn't; I'll still root for her.
Maven.
Maven Maven Maven. Maven. My little Darkling copycat. (Who am I kidding; no villain can top the Darkling.) Throughout King's Cage; we get more insight on Maven and his plans to rule Norta. During Mare's captivity; we find out that Elara had manipulated Maven throughout most of his childhood to make him a perfect prince. Doing so; she also altered his feelings of Cal and his father. Maven says he loved them before; but that it's gone. It kind of made me sad to see him be reduced to this because of his mother. I'm not saying he's a good character; but he's been manipulated to be a villain. Thank God Elara is dead. Even so; he still hasn't changed. And it's clear that he's in love with Mare. Even Mare herself was confused by Maven and his feelings. Clearly; she doesn't like him; but there's something in her that wants to be close to him. Or rather; close to who he was before. Seeing how he is in the end; I doubt he'll get a good ending.
Evangeline.
I was surprised by her appearance. I knew Victoria said there would be a third character with her own POV; but I wasn't expecting Evangeline. Even though she didn't have much story time; we get to know what she and her family is planning. When Mare was rescued by the Scarlet Guard; Evangeline and her family escaped. Turns out; her family; along with other royal houses are planning on overthrowing Maven. Clearly; they aren't happy with recent developments and are now rebelling against Maven and the Lakelands. With this turn of events; I'm actually starting to root for Evangeline. Fuck the Scarlet Guard. Evangeline is where it's at!
Kilorn is there. At least he didn't have a big role in this book and we didn't see much of him. I still want him to die. He better die in the next book.
The Scarlet Guard? Fuck them. They are a rebellion I can't see myself rooting for. Half the time they don't even know what they're talking about. And the other half they're being hypocrites.
There's also something I want to mention. It's pretty obvious that Norta and the other nations/countries/whatever are the result of a war-torn North America. If you look at the map; it's clear that Norta is based on the North-East part of the States and the Lakelands consists of a small part of the States and the majority (I assume) is Canada. And by war-torn; I mean bombs and possible nuclear bombs. My theory (and this is just a theory; it's not 100% fact) is that before the events of Red Queen; bombs were set off in the States and possible nuclear bombs. I believe that the nuclear bombs are what gave the Silvers their powers. Plus it has been said in Glass Sword that the Silvers were persecuted by the Reds because they were different and had deadly powers. Eventually; the Silvers had enough and used their powers to rise to the top and make the Reds be on the bottom because of what they have done.
Now; does this mean the Silvers are in the right? No; but it is understandable that the Silvers had had enough of the Reds persecuting them. I do feel bad for the Reds; but they are now trying to dismantle the Silver hierarchy and live in peace. The problem with that; is the Scarlet Guard seem to care more about Reds being the rulers and the Silvers being at the bottom. History repeats itself and the Reds are a perfect example of that. They think they're trying to make a difference and change; but they're making things worse by creating a war between Reds and Silvers. This is why I cannot root for the Scarlet Guard.
As said previously; this is supposed to be a politically based book. Since Mare is forced to attend events and parties with Maven; she learns about alliances between the different states/countries and their leaders. Later on in the book; Maven is betrothed to the princess of the Lakelands (A.K.A. Canada); sealing an alliance between the two. With the uprise of the Scarlet Guard and other Reds rebelling; Maven needs more power. And what better way than to marry the princess of an enemy country? I actually enjoyed this part of the book. But I also want to knock some sense into Maven. Yes; I'm still in the ship of MarexMaven and I was kind of mad he did this. WHY?!?!?!?!
One last note; I had heard that Victoria doesn't really respond well to criticism. I don't know if this is true; but if it is; then Victoria needs to deal with it. Victoria; people aren't going to like your book. Deal with it.
Verdict
There were parts of King's Cage that were entertaining; but the negatives outweighed the positives. Cameron and parts of the book were the only things I liked. Other than that; the rest was just plain bad. The weakest of the series. I believe the last book will be in big trouble if Victoria doesn't change Mare.

Wasnâ€™t this a trilogy?
Oh; well; I expected nothing and nothing indeed was what I got. And I donâ€™t want to go full on hate so Iâ€™ll be as professional as I can be just because; between Victoria and me; one of us has to be.
This is the third (and not so final) book in the Red Queen trilogy series and it takes place after the events at the end of Glass Sword and we follow Mare during her imprisonment; Cameronâ€™s journey to find her brother and surpriseâ€¦ Evangelineâ€™s own story and drama. And we start off with Mare being Mavenâ€™s trophy.
One of the many things that didnâ€™t work out in the book was Maven. He was no villain and itâ€™s exactly the same problem I had with his motherâ€™s deathâ€¦ they both fell short. I just canâ€™t believe this child has been such a threat when; in reality; he was nothing than a little boy throwing a semi-well thought tantrum. Itâ€™s ridiculous. Not only he behaves like a baby when Mareâ€™s around but also he doesnâ€™t know how to rule the kingdom he has killed so many for.
If someone so stupid clueless as Mare can pinpoint Mavenâ€™s mistakes then you know heâ€™s doing poorly. For all his traps and calculation; House Samos was going to eat him alive and I was so waiting for that. The whole kingdom was witness of the kid they had as a ruler.
I expect the thrones I remember. Diamondglass flames for the kingâ€™s seat; sapphire and polished white gold for the queenâ€™s. Instead; Maven sits upon the same kind of throne I saw him rise from a month ago; when he held me chained in front of the world.
No gems; no precious metals. Just slabs of gray stone swirled with something shiny; flat-edged; and brutally absent of insignia. It looks cold to the touch and uncomfortable; not to mention terribly heavy. It dwarfs him; making him seem younger and smaller than ever. To look powerful is to be powerful. A lesson I learned from Elara; though somehow Maven didnâ€™t. He seems the boy he is; sharply pale against his black uniform; the only color on him the bloodred lining of his cape; a silver riot of medals; and the shivering blue of his eyes.
And I particularly didnâ€™t care when we found out Mavenâ€™s mother actually messed up with his head pretty bad and now he doesnâ€™t know about loving his brother and father. I donâ€™t care about excuses and thatâ€™s something I see time after time â€“can authors stop trying to redeem villains? Why canâ€™tâ€™ they just let them be villains? I enjoy reading about them plotting; being so unapologetic and just doing awful things. I know they have to be complex and being the bad guys isnâ€™t all about them but still; this trend of not letting good villains rise and fall as villains.
Right now I donâ€™t feel thereâ€™s a big villain in the series (since I donâ€™t consider Evangeline a villain per se); so weâ€™ll have to deal with political dramaâ€¦ which could be pretty cool if done right.
If I do a recap of these books; I know Iâ€™ll see that the only reason why our heroes have lost so much it isnâ€™t because of Maven or Elaraâ€™s evil plotting but due to badly planned rescues and fights inside the group and; of course; Mareâ€™s reckless and dumb actions. They all practically run to Mavenâ€™s feet.
Now; Mareâ€¦
You all know Iâ€™m not Mareâ€™s biggest fan. In fact; I hate her. She hasnâ€™t learned a damn thing and this whole time sheâ€™s been a pain in my eyes.
Six months. She was imprisoned for six months and the only thing she got out of it?
It would be a sin to forget my imprisonment. A waste. I know Maven as no one else does. I know the holes in his brain; the pieces he can never make fit. And Iâ€™ve seen his court splinter firsthand.
Uh; good for you Mare but what did you do with that information?
Nothing.
People fear her just for the sake of this book and thatâ€™s quite silly because there are a lot of newbloods deadlier and so much more trained than her. People died for her and I couldnâ€™t get it. Sheâ€™s no savior. She didnâ€™t try to help the Reds in the palace; she didnâ€™t destabilize the kingdom nor did she try to make her own rescue easier. People has done more with less. She spent six months feeling sorry for herself again; pitying/hating Maven; crying over Calâ€¦ and that was it.
Iâ€™m not saying Mare didnâ€™t suffer or that she didnâ€™t have it rough; she did; but she just didnâ€™t make it all worth it and that was a huge problem for me because there was no character development for any of them. If anything; there was a regression.
Mare and Maven are the worst characters in this series.
Cameronâ€™s POV was a waste of time. Her input wasnâ€™t that important and I could have lived without it just fine. She could have been written better but; sadly; she was only used for 2 things: 1. a filler and 2. an inside in the Scarlet Guardâ€™s core.
Her quest to find her brother was something she was talking about since we met her and when it happened was so fast that if you blink; you could miss it. Overall; there wasnâ€™t anything that made me want to read about her.
Cal was cute as always and honorable. He did try to do his best to get Mare back but this book also hurt him. He hasnâ€™t grown up as a character and need some balls; to be honest. Heâ€™s one of the only two people care about in this series and Iâ€™m sad heâ€™s been treated this poorly.
The end of the book did him particularly awful with decisions being taken away from him and him not manning up enough to stop it all. And all of that because he needed to save Mare just to later be treated by her as a traitor for not choosing her. He loves Mare so much and how she loves him back?
I thought it would be different. I thought I would feel different. Calâ€™s touch has not erased Mavenâ€™s. My memories are still there; still just as painful as they were yesterday. And as much as I try; I have not forgotten the canyon that will always stretch between us. No kind of love can erase his faults; just like none can erase mine.
And that was just after they had sex for the very first time. It was Calâ€™s first time; too. That and a slap at the end was all he got from her.
Itâ€™s safe to say he doesnâ€™t deserve Mare and he can do so much better.
I was pleasantly surprise when I read Evangelineâ€™s POV. Not only it increase my love for her but also it was a great way to know her better. I need a whole book about her! Just not written by Victoria; thank you very much.
Sheâ€™s the queen I deserve and along Cal; the only two characters I truly like.
Finding out she loves Elane and that her brother married her so they both could stay together? Thatâ€™s the story I want to read! The whole Samos dynamic was pretty interesting and I wish her POV was introduced sooner.
What bothers me the most about this book is that it couldâ€™ve been good if Victoria had read the critics about her poor writing style. The woman canâ€™t write fantasy or dystopia or whatever this is. And now that she introduced new POVâ€™s itâ€™s obvious Victoria canâ€™t write more than one. Mare; Cameron and Evangelineâ€™s voices were the same. No difference; no a slight change in the perspective or the style.
What would I have done?
*Honed my writing skills. I would have taken some damned writing classes.
*Ditch Cameronâ€™s POV and have Calâ€™s instead.
*Maven (even though I hate him) should have had his POV. Also; make him the villain we have been told but not shown he is.
*Work on Mare. Make her a true heroine; make her less selfish; clever and just better.
*Screw book 4. I wouldâ€™ve made this book longer and be done with it.
*An Evangelineâ€™s spin off is a must. Just one book. Her life before and after the events of the trilogy.
I really donâ€™t know how these books keep getting positive reviews when theyâ€™re bad; thereâ€™s no other way to say it. The Red Queen series had potential. Not an original story but the characters to really stand out of the rest but sadly Victoria canâ€™t even do a semi decent job.

Mare was far less annoying.
I canâ€™t believe Glass sword was a 1 star read for me while this was 4 stars. Who would have thought? Iâ€™m glad I continued reading.
Things I liked
- I love how action-packed this was. Some I saw coming; some I didnâ€™t (view spoiler)
- The first thing I noticed was that this wasnâ€™t in only Mareâ€™s POV and that made me excited because if youâ€™ve been following my reviews and updates of this series; you would know I donâ€™t like her. Ironically; I didnâ€™t really mind her chapters in this. She was aight
- Evangelineâ€™s chapters were my favourite. I just love her and her mob-like family. I love how powerful her father is that he doesn't have to look powerful to be feared. I love her and her brotherâ€™s relationship; although some things were weird about it (view spoiler)
- Although Maven isâ€¦.Maven; he made this book really interesting
- LONG LIVE TIBERIAS THE SEVENTH!!!!! I LOVE CAL; I LOVE HOW KIND HE IS; I LOVE HOW HE RATHER SAVE THAN KILL; I LOVE HOW HE NEVER GIVES UP ON PEOPLE; I HATE HOW PEOPLE TREAT HIM; I HATE HOW HE DOESNâ€™T HAVE ANYONE. DID I MENTION THAT I LOVE CAL????? (view spoiler)
- Calâ€™s grandmother. I love how fearless she is and how loyal she is to her grandson ’•
There were a few things I didnâ€™t like
- I donâ€™t like Cameron. I donâ€™t know why she had a POV. She was so annoying and wasnâ€™t important enough for her own perspective. There were better people I would have loved to have instead of her.
- Mare during the epilogue (view spoiler)
Okay; can we have a Cal and Maven POV in the final book?? And no more Cameron; please.

Maven is content with putting Mare on display; using her to spread his propaganda in public while keep her chained up in the castle at all other times using Silent Stone to repress her powers. The other Silvers are discontent with Maven and move to usurp his power forcing Maven to make alliances with former enemies; Lakelands; to strength his forces. Maven continues to grow paranoid; relying on Mare as his sole confident.
Meanwhile the Scarlet Guard and Cal spend their time organizing and preparing for war. Their alliance with Montfort provides them with much needed supplies and power as well as other New Bloods with experience and training to train the ones the Scarlet Guard has been recruiting. Only time will tell though about Montfort's own intentions for helping the Scarlet Guard and what the price of the alliance may be.
I think this would have been my favorite of the series and even ended up on my favorites shelf if not for a few things. First off I didn't really enjoy Cameron or Evangeline's POVs. I mean it was necessary to keep the reader informed about what was happening outside of Mare's imprisonment but like I love Mare and I can't stand people hating her so I automatically got annoyed with Cameron and Evangeline. I can't help myself because no matter what Mare does I'm just like it's ok I love you always. Second I don't know how much of the history we've started to get I buy into. I understand that they have a certain level of technology and understand genetics but I feel like it was implied both of those have been known about for a while and so I'm wondering why no progress on either end was made? It just feels strange that all of this has existed long enough without anything new happening but long enough for a mutated gene to take over so much of the gene pool. It just seemed in Red Queen that the book was taking place in a time without as much advancement but I guess not. It just doesn't feel coherent and I don't buy it but I'm willing to keep reading and see where this is going. Third I still don't care at all about Cal. He's such a boring character and so cliched. The dark brooding hero. Like go away Cal.
Otherwise I really enjoyed this book. I like that we're getting a more complex picture of the world and the politics in it; and I love seeing how things play out. I know other people didn't enjoy it but I loved it. I also really enjoyed the whole imprisonment arc because of how well done it felt to me. Especially Mare's struggle with her empathy for Maven and how much she misses the person she thought he was. Maven continues to make me want to die because why are you being such a piece of shit but I can't stop feeling sorry for him and wishing he would just cut it out and fix everything god damn it Maven. I love Maven but I hate Maven. I love Farley though and like can't she and Mare run off and raise the baby together and fuck this political bullshit. I also really liked Dane Davidson and I can't wait to read the next book and get more of him. I'm pretty satisfied with how things are unfolding and can't wait for whatever's going to happen next.

Why this book?
I read the other books in this series
What I thought
Why oh why did Victoria Aveyard give Cameron a POV? I couldn't stand the little bitch. Also why her? Why didn't Cal get a POV? Speaking of Cal WTF was Cameron's problem with him? All she did was diss him. She actually made me look forward to the Mare parts just to get out of her head. She also made Mare bearable; that's something I thought i'll never say. The ending is the other problem. Lets just say it upset me okay.
With that said it did have its moments; but I still didn't like the addition to the series . Hopefully the next one is better (less)",352,NEXTBOOK

Meh? But I guess if it means there's going to be a shitload of Maven then I won't complain.
And the cover. Well; I expected... MORE? The bone crown is an interesting idea but it could've turned out a little better. I loved all of the covers in this series so far; including the novellas but this is just meh. And I feel like they're pulling a Harry Potter movie franchise (title sequences get darker as the story itself get darker) with the dark blue. It works I guess but the cover is still throwing me off a bit. I guess we'll see when the actually hardcover comes out.
They made such a big deal about the release of the title and cover but I'm a little underwhelmed. This isn't the best series out there or the most original but it's one of my favorite series so I'll read King's Cage anyways no matter what so I'll just go stop ranting now and sit in the corner with the rest of you lot and wait until next year.

Power seduces all; and it makes us blind.
This book was my most wanted book. I wanted to read this book more than anything. Anything!! When I got my hands on this; I was kind of...repenting. Repenting on what I was wanting.
First of all; this book's beginning was different from Glass Sword's which was kind of very slow. Beginning of this book was looking breath-taking. I thought I would get more than I wanted. But this book couldn't be able to give what I even expected.
OVERVIEW
Book begins exactly where the last book ended. Mare is on the edge of death (apparently) but rather than killing her; Maven sets her for a propaganda. He sets her for every bad deed he will be going to commit.
The main development in this book is HISTORY. We get to know more about the world; how it came into existence; how the discrimination of the world was made; how the war was first started and for what etc...
(view spoiler)
THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE
=> When I saw Maven didn't kill Mare; I was shocked. Then I thought 'Maven couldn't be that kind. Oh! He is Elara's son after all. He will must make her suffer more than she deserves'. But NO. Her punishment was only to wear manacles made of silent stone. With manacles; she was allowed to live like a princess.
=> This book is the most boring book I have ever read. Really! Except for 4 to 5 chapters; this book is a total junk. Useless! Just to waste pages (by which most of the trees could have been saved..lol) and to fill the so-called 3rd book in the series of 4 books. I am not quite understanding this! What is the point in making the series of 4 books? 3 or 2 sounds a lot better for this type of story.
=> Mare; I am beginning to hate her more. The more I was reading her; the more I found myself hating her. She always thinks that everyone is trying to kill her. Her thinking is soo over! Kind of exaggerated. Or at one moment she is willing to be killed and another she is afraid of being killed. She is such a confusion. At least for me.
=> Whenever there is the name of Maven; there must be the name of her mother. Like I don't know Maven is Elara's son. Why there is a need of constant reminder!
=> Cameron; she is more insufferable than Mare. Her POV is a true torture for me. Her POV is supposed to show us the proceedings of Scarlet Guard as Mare is in Maven's so-called Cage. That's okay and I completely understand it. But when this book tells her background; that's not okay for me. Why would I want to know that. She isn't even one of main characters. She is just a filler. This thing just helps in making the book more insufferable.
=> I didn't like how this book has changed Evengeline. Well; I couldn't get the point in doing so. That could have been different.

THINGS I LIKED

I am quite disappointed right now. But equally curious about the last novel. Really hope for a good conclusion. :(

But so is he. My chains are silent stone. His is the crown.â€
Iâ€™m having a real dilemma with this series. On the one hand; itâ€™s easy to read; there are a lot of great characters and an exciting plot.
On the other hand; Mare is still pretty insufferable. She spent 6 months in Mavenâ€™s palace Whitefire; being tortured within an inch of her life and paraded around as a pet the rest of the time. This was a good plot device. However; Mare soon began repeating herself on a regular basis â€I want to kill Mavenâ€ â€œI wish I could kill Mavenâ€ etc. Etc. While her point was valid; I knew how she felt the first time; it didnâ€™t need repeating every couple of pages!
The second half of the book was just as bad. Having escaped her prison all she would do is remind us of the prison she escaped. Like yes I know this - I read 150 pages about it!
I liked the chapters from Cameronâ€™s POV - she was great and super relatable. I also appreciated the few chapters from Evangelineâ€™s POV they were really interesting to see all the inter house politics.
But overall; I canâ€™t get used to Mare. She is vastly irritating. Unfortunately after this ending I still need to read the last one to see how it will all end; because I need to know! But Iâ€™m not sure how much Iâ€™ll enjoy it - my patience with this series is wearing thin. (less)",356,NEXTBOOK

Why???? That ending killed me!!!! Now I see it! Now I feel it! Anyone can betray anyone!
I'm still #teamCal even though he broke my heart.
So; I really loved loved loved what happened the middle of the book until the end! It was amazing.. BUT the beginning was so BORINGGGGGG!! Yess; I said it!!
------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------
King's Cage was lot of surprises:
1) I don't still hate Maven! I was angry because of what he did! I just feel sorry for him. Elara took his love for his brother and father when he was a child and she tried to take his love for Mare but he said it didn't work! I don't think he loves her anymore. I think he did but Elara took his love for her and it became an obsession. Cal wants to find someone who will be able to fix him. Even if they fix him; I don't think that would be redeemed for what he did.
2)I never thought I would say that but I really liked Evangeline!! I will admit that I hated her in the first book but now I understand her. I admire her loyalty to her parents and brother even though it's against her free will and who she wants to be with. It's really sad that Evangeline; Elaine and Ptolemus have a strange agreement! I hope she end up with who she wants!
3)Mare was less annoying; thank God! Mare FINALLY admits her love for Cal and Cal for her! And life was good... so so good.... until that Cal's grandmother(that bitch) had a plan to Cal become a King! Her plan worked and she fucked us up!!!
Cal accepts it!
Cal didn't choose Mare!
Mare didn't choose Cal!
â€œI thought I knew what heartbreak was. I thought that was what Maven did to me. When he stood and left me kneeling. When he told me everything I ever thought him to be was a lie. But then; I believed I loved him.
I know now; I didn't know what love was. Or what even the echo of heartbreak felt like.
To stand in front of a person who is your whole world and be told you are not enough. You are not the choice. You are a shadow to the person who is your sun.â€
4) I don't have anything to say about Cameron even though she had her own POV!
Oww; I have something. Bravo for saving her brother... that's it. I think Kilorn and Cameron would do a good couple. I don't have to say much about him either :P
5)I was so right about Farley's pregnancy!!
Anyway; I admire Farley. She is so strong even though she feels so much pain.
â€œThe person she loved is dead; stolen by someone else. Mine chose to walk away. Chose everything I hate over everything I am. I wonder which hurts more. ""

Small spoilers may insue
DAMN; 'King's Cage' gave me so many feels! And that ending for reals broke my heart ­­. Damn you Cal; damn youuuuuu!!!!! Damn the crown; damn it all to the hells!
Though I did like this book; I gotta say it has to be my least favorite in this series thus far. I guess I was expecting a lot more with Mare's imprisonment and her being King Maven's puppet. Maven; the guy she once loved. Mare was basically left in a room; a room with great accommodations mind you. Sure there was that (ONE) time when she was mentally tortured by a Whisper. Yeah okay; it was pretty freaking bad and I really felt for her!! And being handcuffed with silent stone to suppress her lightning ability that left her feeling a deep sense of loss because she couldn't touch her power... Mare is powerless without her lightning. But still; I would have like a bit more torture or something! Other than Mare's pride being broken and being paraded around for all the world to see it could have been a hells of a lot worse! I'm giving it a 3.5 star because I know it could have so much better :D Victoria Aveyard writing was done very nicely; I just really don't care for Cameron's POV. I am NOT a big fan of her's; all she does is shit talk â™¥Calâ™¥! I really like the plot of these books; the world is well thought out and the characters are pretty fantastic; minus a couple of them lol! Sure; Mare is a bit self-righteous at times and annoying at others but it wouldn't be Red Queen without her :) Even though the ending mad me upset with Cal and his decision; he's sill; my man! I love Cal so very much but its true he really can't make up his own mind and instead; he does as others expect of him. Okay well; I'm gonna keep this one short because I can't wait another minute to start the final book in this series War Storm!!!

Why do authors insist on torturing their readers? I mean; there's the ending to the Crystal Storm and now this. Why shatter my heart into two and make me wait for another year to piece it back together? Why Victoria Aveyard? Why Morgan Rhodes? Why Rick Riordan? WHYYYYYYYYY?!
I still love the torture; so no regrets. Lol
After being stuck with the paranormal romance world â€”which was kinda bleak compared to the YA fantasy worldâ€” I was left craving for a genre like this.
Victoria Aveyard's writing style never changed. It was still captivating and impossible to put down once you started reading it.
The character development of Mare; Maven and Cal was outstanding. They all learned from their past mistakes and changed for the better... or worse.
Mare; her growth as a character was so shocking (See the connection? Lightning girl = shocking. Lol I made myself laugh). From a whiny broken girl she evolved into a cunning and strong willed woman. She refused to believe what she sees and was constantly suspicious about everything.
Cal; I saw only a few glimpses of this broken prince in this book but it was enough to build my love for his character. I mean; aside from the fact that he is smoking hot (that's a pun again) he refused to give up his love for his younger brother. Despite the torture that Maven did to Mare; the deception and the betrayal. He still believes that his brother can change. Not that I can blame him; I love Maven too.
Maven; there's just something broken about him that I wanted to fix and I think that's the reason why people adore Calore. Things about his personality became more crystal clear in this novel. I used to love him more than Cal but I'm afraid I love Cal more than him now; but no need to worry I still love him all the same. Lol
Everything about this book was great; the world building; the characters; the battle; the romance. It all screams perfection and I couldn't agree more to it.

john green fangirls; do your worst. you do not scare me. i am definitely not extremely frightened and emotionally fragile right now.
--------
Well; well; well. John Green. We have to stop meeting like this.
By â€œlike this;â€ I mean: you write a book; I read it; I hate it. Wash; rinse; repeat. Every time! This is lucky number seven! I donâ€™t think itâ€™s working all that well for either of us. For me; at least; itâ€™s definitely getting a little old.
But here we are. I keep using the weird brag/justification of â€œYes; I hate John Green; and no; itâ€™s not because I havenâ€™t read (insert The Fault in Our Stars or Looking for Alaska or Paper Towns here) yet; because yes; Iâ€™ve read all of his books; and yes; the reviews are in; and yes; it was absolutely all bad.â€
Except for the â€œthe reviews are inâ€ part. Because I havenâ€™t really reviewed any of them. I wasnâ€™t on Goodreads in 2006 my dear boy. It has Not been a decade of these shenanigans.
And so; as I continue to use that line of defense against his wildly loyal; unaging group of geeky manic pixie dream girls in training; I continue to argue myself into reading his books. And oh boy do I suffer in return.
This is; unfortunately; not a The Fault in Our Stars type situation. (Never thought Iâ€™d be disappointed by something differing from The Fault in Our Stars!!)
I canâ€™t just write a review of this that is; speaking generously; 92% me quoting the book and being like â€œhahaha can you believe this is just a normal average sentence in this totally real book.â€ (Although there will be a lot of that because HOW CAN I RESIST. Iâ€™m not a superhero.)
This book is not just John Green using cancer as an excuse to make teens fall in love with each other in a way that is profound and sad; or John Green using a missing person to make teens fall in love with each other in a way that is profound and sad; or...using another missing person to make teens fall in love with each other in a way that is profound and sad.
Oh sh*t; oh wait; this book DOES use a missing person to make teens fall in love with each other in a way that is profound and sad. Hahahaha. What is it with John Green and missing people??? Weâ€™re Looking for Alaska. Weâ€™re tearing this Paper Town apart to find Margo.
Hang on; Iâ€™m getting a phone call. What? Itâ€™s official? Iâ€™m the funniest person on Earth? I knew that tearing paper/Paper Towns joke would push me over the edge. Sorry; first runner-up John Mulaney!
So. Back to the point I lost roughly a thousand years ago. Even though this book DOES contain some terrible overwrought pretentious writing; and a manic pixie dream romance; and a missing person; thatâ€™s not its Thing. Like the Thing of The Fault in Our Stars is cancer/death/sadness; the Thing of this book is mental illness. Specifically a combination of anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Which John Green has. This is #ownvoices for anxiety/OCD! Rad.
It makes the whole review-writing thing a tad more complicated though. Because; like. I didnâ€™t like this book. Not because of the mental illness rep. But I canâ€™t just exile the whole book to Garbage Island anymore. Because the rep is good.
My life is so hard; you guys.
The fangirls are going to come for me so bad.
The mental illness rep was good. But also it was still a John Green book and I strongly disliked the process of reading it and; in fact; was forced into a reading slump so hard that it feels like while I was reading this my brain was gently removed from my skull and replaced with a small mound of cotton balls.
I have still not recovered.
Letâ€™s do some categories; yeah?
Also: this book needs a huge huge huge huge huge huge HUGE trigger warning for self-harm. I donâ€™t know why I havenâ€™t seen that mentioned more. I donâ€™t consider self-harm a trigger for myself and I still had to take breaks while reading this.
THE PLOT; ALLEGEDLY
Well.
There isnâ€™t one.
This book has excellent mental illness rep; yes; but it is still a John Green book and that means there is not a plot so much as there is â€œletâ€™s listen to the every thought of some very unbearable and introspective teens for a few hundred pages; shall we?â€
All of this overwhelming pretension and analysis and over description of basic inanimate objects comes at a cost; and that cost is a little something I like to call â€œnot being excruciatingly bored.â€
I read this book on Overdrive; which has that handy-dandy little feature where you can see the proportion of the book youâ€™ve read in a neat lil percentage. By the 5% mark of this book; we have read exclusively about a single lunch period in the life of our protagonist; Aza; which; we are told eight hundred times; is 37 minutes long.
Five percent.
Thirty-seven minutes.
Iâ€™m just going to close out this section here because there is no way I can make it any clearer than that.
ITâ€™S NOT EVEN ORIGINAL YOU GUYS SERIOUSLY
Even though this book feels infinitely long; it is actually only 288 pages. Which is why itâ€™s impressive that this sh*t not only feels unrelentingly verbose; but also unbelievably repetitive.
For example; one of my favorite inexplicable tropes crops up about nine hundred and seventeen times in this book: Teenage Characters With Sh*tty Cars That They Humorously Name And Love With All Their Adolescent Hearts. What a wild clichÃ©!
Our protagonist; Aza; has a dinky little car named Harold. This is one of the only jokes in this whole book; and let me tell you there is some dark sh*t and the comic relief is NEEDED. (This is me attempting to be generous as I wonder why John Green could possibly have included so many iterations of the exact same joke.)
Itâ€™s not just the Harold joke. Itâ€™s also the setting of Applebeeâ€™s; where our characters go one hundred times; the only joke being the exact same premise of how funny it is that they are there; using a - hahaha you guys get ready; I really donâ€™t think youâ€™re prepared for how funny this is - a COUPON!
The Applebeeâ€™s staff hates them; guys. I mean; are you serious? A coupon? In an establishment often predicated on deals and savings? Get out of here; you zany teens. Youâ€™re too much.
Similar to this is the unrelenting onslaught of Details About A Rich Personâ€™s House. Davis; the son of Missing Person Who Makes Teens Realize Things About Love; and also Subject Of Occasional Love When Necessary For Pretentious Pondering; and also Source Of Much Of Pretentious Pondering; is rich as hell. The (innumerable) descriptions of his home sound like 13-year-old me trying to depict teen pop sensation Justin Bieberâ€™s home for a fanfiction I would never even research; let alone complete.
Iâ€™ll spare you the wondering: I was not good at writing fanfiction.
THE LANGUAGE GOOD LORD THE LANGUAGE
Hereâ€™s the thing. I know a lot of people love John Green for his writing. I am not one of those people; obviously; for the established reason that I find him unbearably pretentious; but many of them exist.
But like. Why; guys? Why do you love him? This book could be a master class in the use of the passive voice. I use the passive voice all the time; but a) every professor and teacher Iâ€™ve ever had has kindly asked me to f*cking stop immediately; and b) Iâ€™M NEITHER A WRITING PROFESSIONAL NOR RENOWNED.
But enough of that. Let me just do a liiiiittle bit of quoting. Just to show you guys that Iâ€™m right about how pretentious and overwrought and unnecessary it all is. Itâ€™ll be a Google Translate type situation: Iâ€™ll write the phrase in normal human English; and then weâ€™ll translate it into John Greenian.
Ceiling lights -> â€œfluorescent cylinders spewing aggressively artificial light.â€
He drove faster -> â€œHe accelerated with the gentle serenity of the Buddhist Zen master who knows nothing really needs to be done quickly.â€
Fun; right?
Also; hereâ€™s my FAVORITE THING. So thereâ€™s this passage in the book when Aza goes; â€œI was out of school for two weeks. Fourteen days of my life reduced to one sentence; because I canâ€™t describe anything that happened during those days.â€
So how many sentences do you think came after that? Zero; right? Aza clearly says the whole thing was reduced to one sentence.
GUESS WHAT.
GUESS THE HELL WHAT.
Itâ€™s followed by several paragraphs of description.
Sometimes itâ€™s just too easy.
Anyway; I could keep quoting and quoting these increasingly unbelievable sentences but what would be the point? I hate the way this is written and some people love it and here we are. At an impasse. Not even a bad impasse. (Hereâ€™s where I should have said some sh*t like And yet not even an impasse worth solving - an impasse of opinion; which is also called life; or something like that. This is all; to me; sentiments alternately ordinary and slightly off disguised under the massive weight of gaudy phrasing.)
NOTHING MAKES SENSE. WEâ€™LL ALL BE DEAD SOMEDAY
Hereâ€™s one of my favorite categories! Tiny things that bother me almost as much as the bigger things some might say â€œactually matter.â€
Like; for example; in what world is a security guard responsible for the retrieval of Dr Peppers for quirky teens? (Which is also coincidentally the name of the charity Iâ€™m starting; or at least my band.) That security guardâ€™s salary had best be bigger than Godâ€™s.
Also; this is literally so over-described that John Green forgets his own descriptions. â€œHe was wearing his school polo shirt and khaki pants.â€ Next paragraph: â€œHe had skinny; sunburned legs and knobby knees.â€ SORRY AZA; DID HE TAKE HIS GODDAMN PANTS OFF? DID HE? Iâ€™M SORRY; I MUST HAVE MISSED THAT BETWEEN DISCUSSION OF AN IMMORTAL REPTILE OR WHATEVER. PLEASE GO ON.
And I just want to put this passage here and see if anyone else craves the sweet sweet oblivion of unconsciousness after reading it: â€œThe most recent quote was; â€He who doesnâ€™t fear death dies only once;â€™ which I thought was maybe some veiled reference to his father; but I couldnâ€™t unpack it. (For the record; he who does fear death also dies only once; but whatever.)â€
Okay actually I canâ€™t just let it sit there. Are you KIDDING ME. Is this a deliberate misinterpretation of the quote??? Is this on-purpose dumb??? OBVIOUSLY THE MAN WHO FEARS DEATH DIES MORE THAN ONCE BECAUSE HE CANâ€™T STOP IMAGINING HIS OWN DEATH! To use your own words; John; itâ€™s a goddamn metaphor! It makes sense to put the killing thing between your teeth or what f*cking ever but that eloquent af classic piece of prose is nonsense to you??
Sometimes even Iâ€™m surprised by how much this stuff grinds my gears.
TEEN TALK! WITH A PRETENTIOUS MIDDLE-AGED MAN
A lot of this book lacks the letâ€™s-talk-about-the-evolution-of-the-universe-and-then-the-afterlife-if-thereâ€™s-time-to-spare mentality of most John Green teenage dialogue; but it does Not lack the polished; complete thoughts with that exactly one (1) witticism to every two (2) statements ratio.
Letâ€™s just put some quotes in.
â€œLast night I lay on the frozen ground; staring up at a clear sky only somewhat ruined by light pollution and the fog produced by my own breath - no telescope or anything; just me and the wide-open sky - and I kept thinking about how sky is a singular noun; as if itâ€™s one thing. But the sky isnâ€™t one thing. The sky is everything. And last night; it was enough.â€ Like; have you ever in your godforsaken life read a more perfectly; quintessentially John Green passage than that one? Itâ€™s too good.
â€œAt the end; when walking was work; we sat on a bench looking down at the river; which was running low; and she told me that beauty was mostly a matter of attention. â€The river is beautiful because you are looking at it;â€™ she said.â€
Hereâ€™s a clip of some texting convo for yâ€™all:
â€œHim: Then what am I? What is anyone?
Me: I is the hardest word to define.
Him: Maybe you are what you canâ€™t not be.â€
You know. How teens text!
And then; just when youâ€™re thinking â€œoh; maybe John Green just does pretentious dialogue now. Maybe weâ€™ve escaped the unrelenting yoke of the quirkiness of his characters; the unbearable cringe-inspiring relatable -â€ he cuts you off in the middle of that thought with this sh*t: â€œYou are like pizza; which is the highest compliment I can pay a person.""
God; thatâ€™s just...itâ€™s hard to keep going after that one. Is this a Forever 21 graphic tee from 2011? What is happening right now?
Iâ€™m going to google â€œCody Ko pizzaâ€ to soothe my weary soul. I suggest you do the same.
Anyway; itâ€™s safe to say John Green really â€œgetsâ€ teens; you guys! He understands â€™em. I mean; when was the last time you met a teen whose ideal date wasnâ€™t â€œwandering a freezing cold park; sitting on a bench; and cavalierly mentioning the beauty of the river; only to be well actuallyâ€™d by their girlfriend about the nature of aesthetic appreciationâ€?! I know I canâ€™t remember!
NOW THATâ€™S WHAT I CALL JOHN GREEN
The beginning of this book wasâ€¦not John Green-y. Which; as someone who has declared the aforementioned man my nemesis; is a complete positive. But rather than being pretentious and overwrought and all of those things that make John Green John Green; it was boring. At least passionate hatred isnâ€™t boring. So the introduction of highbrow philosophies related in their polished entirety about a fifth of the way through was almost a relief.
Iâ€™ve already quoted way too many of those highbrow philosophies; though. Either youâ€™re masochistic enough to read the book or you have had Enough Of That.
A lot of this was not typical John Green; but also so much of it was??? The Missing Person thing; for example. Also the classic Uniquely-Named Friends With One Quirk; One Of Whom Is Not White. In this book; we got Daisy Ramirez; Mychal Turner; and Davis Pickett. I read this five months ago so I might be wrong but pretty damn sure everyoneâ€™s heterosexual af. The not-white friend is not the one who occasionally kisses our white protagonist (which is to say; this romance is Caucasian As Hell). You know. Just a touch behind on the diversity memo; outside of the excellent neurodiversity.
But also John Green might just not remember how to be John Green; considering that â€œDaisyâ€™s self-proclaimed life motto was â€Break Hearts; Not Promises.â€™â€ Really; John? You could get that sh*t on a 75% off clearance graphic tee for like four dollars. Itâ€™s been done. Thatâ€™s the best you can do??
Itâ€™s like I donâ€™t even know who you are anymore!
IN WHICH I TRY TO BE NICE
I have two nice-ish things to say.
One; I liked this quote: â€œHeâ€™s in that vast boy middle [â€¦] The whole problem with boys is that ninety-nine percent of them are; like; okay.â€ Extremely true and real.
My other kinda-nice thing is also very irrational and super unfair: I wish that John Green wrote a memoir about his particular mental illness. Because I hate this book for what it is; but I didnâ€™t hate that part of it.
IN WHICH I REMEMBER WHY I REALLY; ACTUALLY HATE JOHN GREEN
Iâ€™m going to close this out with the only part of this book that made me actually furious. All the pretension and boring-ness and overwrought language and whatnot is all fun and games to me. But thereâ€™s a part of this book that is so resoundingly f*cked up; it made me actually angry. Here it is.
â€œMost adults are just hollowed out. You watch them try to fill themselves up with booze or money or God or fame or whatever they worship; and it all rots them from the inside until nothing is left but the money or booze or God they thought would save them. [â€¦] Adults think theyâ€™re wielding power; but really power is wielding them.â€
F*ck this. F*ck this passage. I am not here for this Peter Pan adolescent-glorification egotism. Every single face you see in your entire life is representative of a person who has lived a life. Who has suffered. Just because we donâ€™t all do it while spewing eloquent bullsh*t about constellations and speaking in half unknown literary quotations doesnâ€™t mean weâ€™re all cogs in some machine. We all live and think and feel. Maybe this is the thing I hate most about John Green: the glorification of the â€œweirdâ€ to the detriment of the â€œnormal.â€
Itâ€™s this blatant superiority (including this mocking of alcoholism as if itâ€™s not just as much a mental illness as those of the characters in this book) that makes John Green absolutely unbearable to read.
And so; gang: I think he and I are done. And I canâ€™t say Iâ€™m too upset about it.
Thatâ€™s my bottom line.

Turtles All the Way Down,,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1503002776l/35504431.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/photo/35504431-turtles-all-the-way-down,4.02,John Green,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1406384.John_Green,Young Adult; Fiction; Contemporary,Emily May,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1528390751p2/4622890.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,"â€œYouâ€™re deflecting.â€ I just stared at her. â€œYouâ€™re right that self isnâ€™t simple; Aza. Maybe itâ€™s not even singular. Self is a plurality; but pluralities can also be integrated; right? Think of a rainbow. Itâ€™s one arc of light; but also seven differently colored arcs of light.â€
This is difficult to rate. Looking back; there were definitely certain aspects that I thought were done well; but I just didn't enjoy either the story or the uber-philosophical writing. Given that I consider three stars to be a mostly positive rating; I'm going with two.
Turtles All the Way Down is really only for those looking for deep cell-level evaluation of human consciousness and personhood. To give him some credit; Green captures Aza's needling anxiety and compulsions very well. That little inner voice of doubt that causes you to question things you know until maybe you're not so sure is spot on. It's everything else around Aza's inner turmoil that feels like what it is - filler.
It could very easily have been an interesting portrait of OCD and anxiety; but attempts to add a bizarre subplot of a missing billionaire (who is also the father of her childhood friend; Davis) don't disguise the fact that nothing really happens. I am not opposed to an introspective novel; especially in YA contemporary dealing with mental illness; but I cannot figure out why the author decided to add such a disjointed and nonsensical side story to the mix. Unless; of course; it is yet another ""deep metaphor"" for the nonsensical nature of anxiety; but I would have found Aza's story far stronger without it.
The ludicrous and boring plot acts as a superficial backdrop for Green to play out the usual ""super precocious teens having philosophical conversations."" Aza's mental illness and Green's philosophy bleed together into statements that are straddling the line between clever and nauseating:
I guess I just donâ€™t like having to live inside of a body? If that makes sense. And I think maybe deep down I am just an instrument that exists to turn oxygen into carbon dioxide; just like merely an organism in this . . . vastness.
I had very little patience with hipster teens being hipster back when I was the age of these characters; I have even less now.
I don't know why Green has to create such annoyingly unrealistic carbon copies of himself. Even secondary characters like Daisy quickly become annoying - calling Aza ""Holmesy"" in literally every sentence she speaks is extremely irritating. And these text messages between Aza and Davis:
Me: Youâ€™re not your money.
Him: Then what am I? What is anyone?
Me: I is the hardest word to define.
Him: Maybe you are what you canâ€™t not be.
Me: Maybe. Howâ€™s the sky?
Him: Great. Huge. Amazing.
It's not even right to say these characters don't talk like teenagers because that makes it sound like teens can't possibly be this smart (and they definitely can); but these characters just don't talk like any people I've ever encountered anywhere. Of any age. They sound like what I imagine old buddhist monks to sound like.
Green takes steps toward exploring the painful reality of living with a mental illness that deeply affects your everyday life and wellbeing; but it's sad that he pulls it back into the land of pretentious philosophical mumbo jumbo. For a while there; it felt real to me; and then it just became John Green talking to himself about the universe and the nature of ""self"". I guess I have to accept that early John Green - the kind who wrote Paper Towns - is a thing of the past.

Iâ€™ve loved it for so long that I persevere on; remembering that there are gems; that there are treasures; but increasingly Iâ€™ve found myself worried - have I grown out of it? Have I overdone it? Each novel seems to be repeating some unspoken pattern; or at least trying to make something new out of the same ingredients. It was with trepidation; then; that I wandered in to Turtles All The Way Down; thinking â€œyes; Iâ€™ve liked John Green books in the past; but maybe that was before I had grown tired of the same ingredients.â€ â€¦ NOPE. ITâ€™S GREAT. YA IS ALIVE AND WELL.
Like always; Iâ€™m thankful for Greenâ€™s refusal to dumb anything down. He treats his teenagers like adults because they are adults; or nearly are; and at the very least deserve the same respect as adults. When we are introduced to Azaâ€™s life; and her way of living it; nothing is hidden. Her anxiety and mental health continue to be an unrelenting problem in the narrative because they are an unrelenting problem in her narrative. It doesnâ€™t ease up; it doesnâ€™t get fixed; and at times it is nearly physically painful to read about a sad girl who canâ€™t get better. You do just want to reach into the pages and give her a shake; or a hug; and tell her to please get better. But thatâ€™s the point. She canâ€™t. Or not forever. And thatâ€™s okay. Because sheâ€™s still lovely and wonderful and loved.
I have a particular love for the ending. My dad and I agree that watching a good movie is more fun the second time. Now you know that every thing is going to be all right and you can just relax and enjoy it. I went into the ending so nervous that it would be cheesy; or unrealistically hopeful; or really unnecessarily sad. I was so surprised by an ending that moved on from being a teenager; looked at a life beyond teenage hood; that I nearly cried. I nearly cried because not enough teenagers hear that what theyâ€™re going through truly matters; but also that they'll be leading a completely different life very soon. It was something I told my brother constantly when he was still in high school and I had gone on to University and suddenly had to try and remember how hard high school had been.
A note on technology: I feel very strongly about the use of technology in YA. It frustrates me to no end when a teenager â€œleaves their phone at homeâ€ or â€œruns out of dataâ€ or â€œdoesnâ€™t think to text someone something time sensitive.â€ It isnâ€™t the way that teenagers function; it doesnâ€™t make any sense; it ignores a huge part of the way that teenagers understand themselves and each other; and can you tell that I really care about it yet? John Green does the impossible here: he manages to include technology organically; to make it important to the story and to their lives; but without making it gimmicky. For that; I am also thankful.
Finally; I am thankful for this representation of mental health. It is ugly; sad; disturbing; frustrating; but not hopeless. It isnâ€™t everything (even though sometimes it is) and itâ€™s honest. I am so happy; so unbelievably happy; that kids and teenagers and also adults will have this. That they will read it and feel understood; or empathize; or both. You know how we always want books to â€œmake us better peopleâ€? To â€œshow us new perspectives we couldnâ€™t imagineâ€? Pick up Turtles All The Way Down.
Full disclosure: I read an early version of the book and worked with John Green and his editor; and my name is in the acknowledgments! The posting of this review is unrelated to the work I did! (less)",363,NEXTBOOK

The Long
It's hard to believe I just read a new John Green (JG from now on) book. My mind can't really wrap around that. (Especially given where I was 5 years ago; not even knowing BookTube existed; now I can't imagine my life without BookTube and being Hailey in Bookland). But it was a pleasure to read his writing again. He is extremely talented. I was super nervous going into this admittedly. After the smash success of TFIOS I couldn't imagine a more high pressure situation. Especially as I haven't absolutely loved all of his novels; I just didn't know where this one would fall for me. But I'm so happy that I loved it. It's definitely my favourite YA book on mental illness that I've ever read.
What sets JG apart and makes him; IMO; a pioneer in the YA genre; is the fact that he writes knowledgable teenage characters. He doesn't discount teenagers as unintelligent due to their developing brains. He recognizes that teenagers; IRL; are able to comprehend complex concepts. (This may seem obvious; but I read a book on writing books for young readers recently and it emphasizes the fact that you have to use the most simplistic language possible so young teenage minds can understand it. BS. Teenagers are not dumb).
Because of this; his characters are so startlingly relatable. I think Aza is an especially relatable character for me with her struggles with anxiety. The way JG describes her experiences with anxiety spoke to me so intensely. Specifically the metaphor of the spiral. Blew my mind in all honesty. JG definitely has a talent for metaphors; I never get sick of it. He's always had a way of finding the perfect words to describe that which seems indescribable. Seeing him use this technique regarding mental illness was fascinating. I think if you do; or ever have; suffered from mental illness; you will vastly appreciate his narrative.
I found this story to be very different than JG's other novels. Not in a bad way at all; but the plot was much more subtle. There are two plots happening simultaneously really; one internally and one externally. You think you're following the one and then it turns out the other is the central focus. The way the two were interwoven was genius.
I think this has been written in a way that will appeal to both the next generation of YA readers as well as the aging generation of YA readers. Typically JG's novels have the romance as a main focal point; and they really are some of my favourite romances; but here the romance takes a back seat. The front seat is occupied by Aza's own personal mental health journey. It was such a nice change. (That's not to say there is no romance; it's there but it's just not the main topic).

First off; we can argue a bit about the setting. His early work would suggest that he prefers warm places; but over the years he has slowly migrated to the Midwest.We can assume that this time it will be set on the sun; for the conditions are best for cultivating our feels; and destroying our hope.
Next; we can examine the characters. They must be the perfect combination of witty; socially awkward; beautiful; and of course; burdened with a great amount of tragedy and overwrought with pain. I'm guessing ex-convict and clown. Good pairing
The plot is tricky; you see; for this varies greatly book to book. The spectrum is quite wide. I'm going to guess it'll be a complex story that weaves together the lives of the ex-convict who becomes the first great poet in years; and the young circus clown who keeps having dreams of the constellation Hercules. Yes; this sounds about right. I think they will need to save the world from llamas.
And the romance. One mustn't forget the romance. All you really need to know is it will break your heart.
So; if I have guessed correctly; this book will be about a past criminal mastermind and a clown; living on the sun. Together they will stop llamas from taking over the universe.
Or; y'know; worst comes to worst and it's twilight fanfiction.
Whatever it is; I'm sure we will I CAN'T;""ASFJSDFLK"" and feel all of the feels.
UPDATE: So; we have a title. This is clearly about wimbleton and its philosophical after effects. (less)",367,NEXTBOOK

I'm actually floored by how good it was. I mean; I haven't read a ""new"" John Green novel in forever; but this is worth the wait. I wasn't actually nervous going in. It's about mental health (#OWNVOICES I REMIND YOU) and missing persons and smol sad rich boys and everything about this just shouts that it's my kind of novel. It really really hit home so hard for me. I loved it.
OK note on the title: I see a lot of people complaining about the lack of turtles and like...I'm sorry but I'M LAUGHING. HAVE YOU NOT MET JOHN GREEN. It's a metaphor!! The title of the book being a metaphor is like perfect. (I mean no one complained about the towns not being made of actual paper in Paper Towns so I don't even get how everything thinks this is different.) THE BRAND IS ON POINT.
Anyway. Excuse me. I have an enthusiasm for this book.
+ OK so the plot was really amazing!
Bit slow but really really good. I loved that it wasn't rife with cliches or annoying tropes. It was just so pure almost. It felt actually real. It's not really a ""detective"" story (I thought it was going to be??) but Aza is lowkey curious about the mission millionaire because she used to know his son; Davis. She does a bit of digging; but she does more investigative work on Davis. So.
+ Aza was honestly amazing.
She is EXTREMELY quiet. She probably hardly ever talks and she's very much locked in her own head. And I HATE that that's a negative. Because be in your own head if you want; I say. I appreciated that she's quiet and that she thinks a lot. She's obviously extremely intelligent. ALL JOHN GREEN'S CHARACTERS ARE. I love how ""pretentious"" they are because I was 100% like that as a kid. Let's talk about the stars and metaphors and what poetry means and the infinite possibilities of death and life. The sheer amount of knowledge these kids spew out is just refreshing and perfect to me. I am HERE for smart people. (Also because I'm not one so it'sl ike??? Nice. Thanks. Let me osmosis the intelligence.)
+ The anxiety/OCD was really brutally and honestly talked about.
The only thing I'm angry about is that the word ""OCD"" is never used. I actually hate when books do this and it would've made me really upset reading if I hadn't already have known from listening to vlogs/interviews. I'm the kind of person who wants to KNOW and have solid answers. And I think OCD should've been stated because...liek this isn't your typical ""oh she lines everything up and washes her hands 298 times a day"" sort of OCD that books like to present. This is the real and brutal version of OCD. And the fact that we get like the thought-spirals and the psychology behind it is what is the BEST in my opinion. You are not watching someone with OCD; you are experiencing what it's like to have OCD while reading this book. And that's freaking important ok.
+ I have mixed feelings about Aza and Daisy's friendship tho...
I mean; I LOVED them as friends but then Daisy (view spoiler) Aaaanyway. Still (mostly) a good female-to-female- frienship that WASN'T built on obsessing over boys or being catty! YAS.
+ AND CAN WE TALK ABOUT DAVIS? WHO IS SUPER ADORABLE AND I LOVE HIM.
It was like SUCH a cute romance. Slow and cautious and fraught with problems just from Aza's OCD and Davis insurmountable grief. He was also the BEST big brother ever and I just... <3 <3 I loved how geeky and nerdy and beautiful he was. Honestly. DAVIS.
+ It's also really DEEP.
Like it talks psychology a lot and some of the metaphors were really intense and like wow. It was so layered. I LOVED it.
+ And yes I teared up at the end.
I mean. It's a John Green novel. I LOVED the ending and I hated it and I LOVED IT and just ajfdsakld I have at least 4 emotions which is double as many as I usually have. Goddamn. I'm not used to this I need to sit down.
ALL IN ALL: I think this is an absolutely deep and existential book that really discusses minds and who we are. It's sad and it's not sugar coated. Liking a boy doesn't make Aza ""better"" (lol @ that trope; John Green dismantles it SO WELL) and there's no messages that you need to be fixed to have a good life. Your mental illness isn't ALL of you; but it is some of you. And as someone who has anxiety disorders too; I really appreciated this. I appreciated the whole heckin' book.
FOREVER A JOHN GREEN FAN.

This book was; well...not good.
I went into this with somewhat high hopes.
I knew it was about a girl with anxiety issues and - as someone who struggled with a lot of anxiety as a hormone-ridden; depressed teen who lost a parent at a young age myself; (much like Aza) I expected to really connect with this story.
At least on some level.
One reviewer I follow even ranked this as her top read of 2017. Said it was ""life changing.""
LIFE CHANGING.
To each their own and all that jazz - truly; I'm happy other people got something out of this book -but; in my opinion; for something to change my life - or at least remotely affect me in any way - it has to have at least some depth to it.
And this book had about as much depth as the shallow end of the kiddie pool.
Now; I realize that I - a 35 year old woman - am not the targeted demographic for this book; but still...
There has to be at least some point to a book.
Character development...a cool plot...a semi-decent romance; even...
But this book?
Had basically no plot.
No true character development that I can see...
And perhaps the most simplistic ""moral of the story"" I've ever seen.
So let me save you a few bucks or a trip to the library and just give you what amounts to the entire point of this book here:

â€œSpirals grow infinitely small the farther you follow them inward; but they also grow infinitely large the farther you follow them out.â€
Well; this is awkward.
I went into this thinking I wouldnâ€™t like it. Heck; I went into it pretty much expecting to dislike. And yes; I know thatâ€™s a horrible thing to say; and a terrible reason to read a book; but come on; you can hardly blame me.
I hated The Fault in Our Stars; with all of its extremely pretentious characters (although I did cry at the end; and actually liked the movie). I then left Looking for Alaska; halfway through after a friend spoiled the ending (thanks a lot; Megan!) I also couldnâ€™t get past chapter five of Paper Towns; (mostly because I had already seen the movie and hated Margo).
So; Turtles All the Way Down; was me giving John Green one last shot. And you know what? I liked it. I actually; genuinely liked it.
This book is classic John Green. You got the two teenagers from well to do families who sit around contemplating the meaning of the universe with all the knowledge and wisdom of college philosophy professors and the vocabulary of a SAT test book.
And yet; in spite of all of these things; I actually enjoyed this one. Maybe because Aza and Davis didnâ€™t come across as annoyingly pretentious as Augustus and Hazel had.
So; the story is about Aza; a girl dealing with spiraling thoughts that are entirely out of her control. She feels trapped and bullied by her mind as her anxiety takes over. And yet; she tries her best to be a good friend and daughter and to live the life she wishes she had.
Itâ€™s also about Davis; a billionaire boy with a missing father; who is trying his best to be a good influence for his 13-year-old brother.
Itâ€™s also about mental illness and family and friendship and falling in love. Really; itâ€™s about a lot of things; but more on that later.
I think John Green does an excellent job at portraying Azaâ€™s illness and the way that thoughts can sometimes control a person. I know firsthand how hard it can be to deal with invasive thoughts. I know that sometimes the mind seems like a different entity from the self and John Green wonderfully showed all the thoughts going through her head. More so; he did it in a way that properly displayed mental illness.
I liked the romance also; although at points it was a little too philosophical for my taste. I liked that love doesnâ€™t fix mental illness. I liked that the world goes on and good things happen and sometimes bad things happen. I also like the way that mental illness is portrayed as affecting not just the individual but also those around them. I loved seeing how family and friendships are tested and yet remain. Truly; I think that it was all brilliantly done and I must say; kudos to John Green because I could actually relate.
So; why not a higher rating? Well; this book felt like it was trying too hard. It was too many things. It took a great story and stretched it out to the point that the plot seemed thin. It felt out of focus and it greatly diminished my liking of it.
I think it could have had a greater emotional impact if it had focused on only one thing; either Aza and her troubles; or Davis and his missing father. It could either be a look into mental illness or a mystery. Or; it could be both if it were longer and found a way to combine the two. But; alas; it did not.
Overall; I really enjoyed it and totally recommend. I am actually looking forward to whatever John Green writes next.

I hate when I have a middle of the road review to write; I like to feel passionately about a book one way or another; and I almost feel it is easier to share my feelings on a book that is a 1-2 star than any of the 3 stars that come along. I feel at a loss for words to describe my experience while reading this book; I've seen multiple reviews state they felt Turtles All the Way Down wasn't even on the same level as The Fault in Our Stars; and I have to agree. While this wasn't a BAD story per se; it didn't feel up to the John Green standard we've come to expect. Multiple times I was stopped by randoms at the gym asking how it was; because it was on their wish list; and I could never muster anything more than ""This book is fine. Fine is what it is. It is not great; but it is fine"" and I felt guilty for that.
For such a short book with big font and little chapters and lots of spacing between lines; this book sure was slow in the first half. I believe he was going for atmospheric; but when I think of setting the tone in a slow building way; I think of descriptive writing that can be filled with prose or not; but definitely something that draws me in and makes me feel a part of the story; and that's not what happens here. The narrative is very jerky and disjointed; and it took awhile for my brain to become engaged enough to care what was happening. I think the premise of this book; minus the billionaire side story (but I'll get to that in a minute); was excellent. I love YA books featuring mental health issues and illnesses and this was by far the strongest aspect of the plot. I didn't find Aza likable in the beginning; but I feel that was the point so that we could form a connection with her as she grows and becomes aware of herself in new ways.
Honestly; I really could have done without the awkward side story of Davis and Noah's missing father. I didn't feel it added to the story; actually; I felt it took away from some of the more important factors since it stole coverage where those pages could have been used to further the main focus. I couldn't help but wonder what felt off; and I think it came down to a rushed characterization of Davis; Aza; and their relationship. It almost felt as if chunks of the story were missing and we were just supposed to fill it in our own way. I would have liked a little more development; but that's just me. I did feel the ending was another strong point; it was messy; uncomfortable; and slightly disturbing; but added a gleaming spark of hope and a viewpoint of recovery for those struggling with various mental health issues and disorders.
Please don't toss this book aside and chose not to read it just because it didn't wow me; I think it has some very valuable insight into a very tough subject that is still taboo in 2017. There are plenty of 5 star reviews that are much better than mine and I hope you enjoy it more fully than I did. Maybe I'm getting too old for this type of YA contemporary or maybe I'm just out of touch with how teenagers behave and converse; so I think I'll just say that it was fine; but the over hyping of this book pre-production may have done more harm than good for the die hard fans.

â€• John Green; Turtles All the Way Down
Wow. This book was stunning. Hard to read (trigger warnings for OCD and anxiety); but Jesus; did it feel healing at the same time.
John Green wrote the shit out of this book. The way mental health was portrayed through Aza was excruciating; harrowing and educational to read about and it still made me feel that though the stigma might have lessened a bit; the understanding of this subject is narrow.
I felt this book to my core. I was there with Aza when she was spiralling out of control; her mind constantly pulling her in different directions; finding no centre; the constant doubt hurling you further into finding no fixed point; so that you may breathe and focus.
I've so much admiration for Green for writing so openly in this book. It was so raw and bleak and the ugly side of mental health truly came to live; because that's how it is and what it can manifest into.
And though; it may seem difficult to find hope; a way to see the light at the end of the tunnel that seems never-reaching; it is there. It is tangible and can be found. (less)",374,NEXTBOOK

This book this FUCKING BOOK. I devoured it in under a day! I couldn't leave it down even though I had studying to do. I was there; with Aza; feeling what she was feeling; understanding even though I don't suffer from it; wanting to ""heal"" her even though I know I couldn't. This book was so deep (too deep for teenagers but that's John Green for ya) and it entailed so many excellent quotes that cut deep into me. The other characters were brilliant; too (even though Daisy just pissed me off at times); the Star Wars references were cute; being a SW nerd myself; I relate (even though the Rey x Chewbacca parts were sort of weird) and I think he did his research a lot for this book. 6 years is a lot of time and he really produced amazing work out of them.
I'm so looking forward to the movie I heard that is coming out; (a John Green book not becoming a movie would be a first) I hope they do it justice. It was the first of his books I read before the movie comes out not because of the movie so I'm really curious to see what their angle will be about it.

____________________________________
No one ever says goodbye unless they want to see you again.
I must admit that never in a million years; would have expected to find myself in a situation like this; one where I'd end up completely put off guard by a book I'd never even considered reading in the first place.
I'm not a huge John Green fan. I've read his previous works and; even if I didn't completely despise them; the whole JG phenomenon never really felt to me like a complete mind-blowing experience that I absolutely had to be part of.
Then why does this book changes the entire game; you might ask?
Well; first of all; there was a lot to relate to. And I'm not only talking about all those pop-culture references and the exquisitely colloquial writings. I mean; yes; they're quite necessary if you look at it from a certain angle; and they serve their filling purpose greatly; but it's something else; really.
As simple as it sounds; I found myself utterly and painfully represented by the issues this book portraits; and I couldn't help but see my own fight against the same angsty and suffocating thoughts the main character; Aza; has to struggle with on a daily basis; as well.
It's really something that doesn't happen everyday.
Aza is a complex and damaged character; one of those charries I usually am drawn to; only this time it was because her character sometimes appeared very adult-coded; so it was a case of mutual and shared vision of life.
Through the pages; you get to see her journey; in and outside her head; and; I don't know if it's just me being me; but some of the things she does and says are things I thought I was the only one doing.
Talk about relatable MC's! I like her; so so so so much.
Green's characters once again fall a bit on the clichÃ© side; but I got to give it to him. When they start throwing tantrums; I don't blame them; because they're young and immature; just like they should be.
And when they learn from their mistakes; is even better.
Aza's mum is probably the purest character I've seen in years. She's adorable. I respect the shit out of that woman; I admire her for being so strong and for keeping herself together for her daughter's sake even when things are shitty. She's a good mum and a good role model.
Love interests aren't usually a problem for me; except for when they become love-interests-period. This time around; it was Davis' turn and; I've got to say it; I adore the guy.
Just like Aza; he's walking a wire; with one foot dangling from the edge of the darker side; constrantly fighting to live up to a family name he didn't choose himself.
And he's so... Likeable; you know? At least for me.
I mean; he's got this whole Gansey thing going on (cute and nerdy rich boy; wears khakis and polo shirts; has a frigging diary) and he loves poetry. No; let me rephrase that: he loves and writes poetry.
*sticks gold star on davis forehead*
Back to us...
So; reason #3 this book is the best I've read this month: the plot is so blunt and easy to follow; that it flows perfectly with whatever mood you might be in that moment. Sure; it's not the thriller of the year nor the best contemporary that deals with heavy themes; but if you put all the elements together and follow the recipe step by step; you're in for an adventure.
The quotes sprinkled all over the book; in a certified Green fashion; the very same quotes I've always found a bit pretentious in the other books; add a sense of poetry (as if there was little of it already! *puts another gold star on davis forehead*); a sense of being known.
The romance is light but at the same time very intense. It's not even that much eye-rolling; if you know what I mean.
Some Davis/Aza scenes really left me out of breath; not gonna lie; but I really did like Aza and Daisy's interactions just as much. I speak from personal experience when I say it's not easy being friends with people who have social anxiety and/or ocd (especially since they; we; take a little more than others to open up to people and let them in); so I appreciate the author's effort of showing how relationships and dynamics can work out with a little help from both sides. And it's not always sunshine and rainbows; that be clear. I also think Green does an amazing job at presenting you both sides of the medal; backstabbing and wishful thinking included.
I think this was the first time in ages I had to physically keep myself from reading an entire novel in one day; because I didn't want it to end too soon.
I'm glad I found; in this unexpected surprise of a book; a story that made me feel a little less alone in the world. (less)",377,NEXTBOOK

You're the storyteller and the story told. You are somebody's something; but you are also your you.â€
I went into this with a bowl full of low expectations but with a side of high expectations. And it tasted good.
It's been a while since John wrote a book. The first John Green book I ever read was TFIOS; which I loved. During the time that passed until the release of Turtles All the Way Down I caught up with most of his other books; apart from An Abundance of Katherines. Will Grayson; Will Grayson was meh but Paper Towns and Looking for Alaska straight up sucked. It made sense that I was torn whether I wanted to read TALWD or not. But I'm glad I did.
The plot wasn't all the exciting. I saw lots of people complain about an absence of plot; but some stories are more character-driven than others; as in this case. Apart from this; there were lots of subplots that I loved - Daisy's relationship with Mychal for once; or the disappearance of Pickett Senior.
The characters were fantastic. First and foremost there is Aza; a teenage girl battling with anxiety. While she did not say much; I enjoyed her narratorial point of view. She was a fleshed out character with lots of depth; which is such an improvement to John's previous main characters that were part boring and part even more boring. Now; I don't struggle with an anxiety disorder. I can't possibly judge this novel from that perspective because I never experienced anything similar to what Aza struggles with on a daily basis. But this book managed to make me feel what a person with an anxiety disorder might possibly have to go through - so much that I could only skim the parts where the main character's anxiety surfaces and takes over all her thoughts and actions.
With Daisy; Aza's best friend; it was love at first sight. This girl is precious. I loved everything about her.
I never warmed up Davis; Aza's love interest; if that is what you want to call him. I don't think that I fully got him and I'm not entirely sure why Aza was drawn to him. On one hand; their relationship lacked romance; on the other hand; I'm glad that this was not one big love story. It would not have fit into the story.
Overall I simply liked this novel. Money was one of the story's central themes; and while I'm both uncomfortable with and in awe of this unfathomable wealth depicted in it; I also deeply connected with Daisy; when she talked about what being poor can be like. Of course; wealth and poverty are extremely subjective topics and people hate to talk about money; but I think John Green managed to find a good balance.

Now I give all of the stars to Aza; Davis and Noah.
I loved Aza so much and as I have mental disorders I can totally relate to her. She's a wonderful character.
Davis is her boy ish friend and he's awesome too. Noah is his brother. They are totally rich and their father is missing. So this is about finding each other and finding a missing father. A few other things thrown into the mix.

I was so overly eager for any new John Green book related content that I made the mistake of reading the excerpt shared on Buzzfeed last month. I say mistake because when I opened up the book weeks after having read the first two chapters; I only had this vague recollection that certainly wouldn't help to continue from where I'd started. Rereading was key.
To give you a bit more background on why I was so eager: Back in 2014; John Green was one of the first authors I'd read that introduced me to the magic of books. I owe a lot to his writing that sucked me in so completely; only to leave me craving for more by the last page; which then led me to look up what next book would satisfy that particular hunger. And here we are today.
Despite all the above; I still went into Turtles All the Way Down with little to no expectations as to what was to come. I knew that though I had history with TFIOS; when I look back on certain scenes; I can't help but feel shivers of disgust (like when the ""two very privileged caucasian Americans who have never known starvation; genocide; or physical abuse"" kissed in the Anne Frank house; which Ariane tells like it is in this article). So if anything; I was apprehensive as to what this newest work would contain.
It all begins with a fugitive billionaire and the promise of a cash reward. Turtles All the Way Down is about lifelong friendship; the intimacy of an unexpected reunion; Star Wars fan fiction; and tuatara. But at its heart is Aza Holmes; a young woman navigating daily existence within the ever-tightening spiral of her own thoughts.
I feel like the only way I can accurately describe the heart of the book is by borrowing this phrase: Captures the everyday moments of teens' lives and then sets fire to those moments; heightening them until they become metaphor.
â€œTrue terror isnâ€™t being scared; itâ€™s not having a choice in the matter.â€
I have so much my mind is eager to spit out; so I think a list is in order (mild spoilers ahead):
â€¢ Let's start with Aza; who surprised me so much with her strong will and great depth of character. Her thought process and spirals gave me a keen insight into the works of the mind and expanding my view on things. What I wasn't expecting; however; was having my own thoughts staring back at me from the page. From staring down the rabbit hole that is social media stalking your crush (#exposed); to vocalizing my exact fears on the reality of dating:
â€œIâ€™m really not looking to date anyone.â€ I know people often say that when secretly looking for a romantic partner; but I meant it. I definitely felt attracted to some people; and I liked the idea of being with someone; but the actual mechanics of it didnâ€™t much suit my talents. Like; parts of typical romantic relationships that made me anxious included 1. Kissing; 2. Having to say the right things to avoid hurt feelings; 3. Saying more wrong things while trying to apologize; 4. Being at a movie theater together and feeling obligated to hold hands even after your hands become sweaty and the sweat starts mixing together; and 5. The part where they say; â€œWhat are you thinking about?â€ And they want you to be; like; â€œIâ€™m thinking about you; darling;â€ but youâ€™re actually thinking about how cows literally could not survive if it werenâ€™t for the bacteria in their guts; and how that sort of means that cows do not exist as independent life-forms; but thatâ€™s not really something you can say out loud; so youâ€™re ultimately forced to choose between lying and seeming weird.â€
â€¢ Greenâ€™s style has grown and matured a lot for me with his newest work. Itâ€™s equal parts dark; hilarious; and achingly real. Plus; the dialogue is amazing. Speaking of the latter; the main reason why is thanks to the effervescent Daisy; who's a force to be reckoned with; from writing her own Rey/ Chewbacca fanfiction to her inspiring directness.
â€œHave you ever gotten a dick pic?â€ she asked in lieu of saying hello.
I feel like she and Ilana Wexler would get along perfectly. Actually; I've never been surer of something.
â€œI mean; how am I supposed to react to a semi-erect penis as fan mail? Am I supposed to feel intrigued?â€
â€œHe probably thinks itâ€™ll end in marriage. Youâ€™ll meet IRL and fall in love and someday tell your kids that it all started with a picture of a disembodied penis.â€
John Green isnâ€™t afraid to let loose with his newest work. And Iâ€™m digging it.
â€¢ Speaking of which; the direction the author took with Aza's mental illness felt like the most honest portrayal I'd read in ages.
â€œI wanted to tell her that I was getting better; because that was supposed to be the narrative of illness: It was a hurdle you jumped over; or a battle you won. Illness is a story told in the past tense.â€
...
â€œI would always be like this; always have this within me. There was no beating it. I would never slay the dragon; because the dragon was also me. My self and the disease were knotted together for life.â€
â€¢ I got educated on such a vast array of topics; without ever feeling like I was lectured. The random history and science lessons really give away who the author of this novel is. From the history of Indianapolis (the setting of the book); to the genetically distinct creature called tuatara; to this weird parasite called Diplostomum pseudospathaceum. I can't deny how utterly fascinating John Green made all of his swift lessons.
â€œWhat I love about science is that as you learn; you donâ€™t really get answers. You just get better questions.â€
â€¢ The bits of romance seemed slightly off-kilter with the flow of the story at first; but it just so happened that I was in the rare mood for a budding romance to indulge in. Actually; it turned out to be quite nice; since it first and foremost focused on two teens taking comfort in talking with someone that gets them to a whole new level.
â€œIn the best conversations; you donâ€™t even remember what you talked about; only how it felt.â€
â€¢ The fact that we get to read inserts from Davis's blog post & poetry entries; and Daisy's successful fanfiction. The particular Davis piece below rang in my ear for a very long time.
â€œThe next one stopped me cold:
â€œThe greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another.â€
â€”WILLIAM JAMES
I donâ€™t know what superpower William James enjoyed; but I can no more choose my thoughts than choose my name.
The way he talked about thoughts was the way I experienced themâ€”not as a choice but as a destiny. Not a catalog of my consciousness; but a refutation of it.
When I was little; I used to tell Mom about my invasives; and she would always say; â€œJust donâ€™t think about that stuff; Aza.â€ But Davis got it. You canâ€™t choose. Thatâ€™s the problem.â€
â€¢ On a totally separate note; I couldn't help but think of Richard Campbell Gansey III from The Raven Boys when Davis was first introduced; thanks to his obscene amount of family money.
â€œYou mean; when a movie comes out in theaters; it . . . also comes out at your house?â€
I never thought weâ€™d have someone upstage Gansey... And yet here we are.
â€¢ But what came quite unexpectedly was how connected I felt to Noah; who's the 13-year-old brother. We see him truly struggle with the fact that his dad up-and-left with no clue of his whereabouts. But what hit most was the fact that Noah had no one to cry out to. Davis is barely getting by on his own; so his younger brother has to figure things out mainly by himself. And reading that just took a piece right off me.
â€œItâ€™s all right to be scared; Noah.â€ And then he turned his face away from me and started sobbing. â€œYouâ€™re okay;â€ I told him; lying. â€œYouâ€™re okay. Heâ€™ll come home.â€
Though the premise is set to be about making â€œconnections that crack open the long-dormant case of Russell Pickettâ€™s disappearance;â€ Turtles All the Way Down is at its core a character-driven novel; favoring the development of the characters' relationships with one another; which is how I like 'em. All this to say: I'm beyond eager to see what Green has next in store for us.

i also really appreciate the personal side of this story and could really feel a difference with this book compared to his pervious works. i think greens own struggles with OCD just made the book all the more genuine and honest. and because of this; there couldnt have been a better portrayal of thoughts for a main character who suffers from anxiety and specific triggers.
i thought this was so well done and i loved everything about it!

UHU. I just bumped to 2 stars because I am reading a 1-star book right now and this is not at that level. I can truly appreciate the OCD representation in Aza so yeah let's leave it at 1.5 near 2.
âž½ FULL REVIEW NOW POSTED.
My problem was expectations. I thought I would relate; I didnâ€™t. My problem was feeling. I thought I would feel; I couldn't.
JG fans please don't throw tomatoes at me. Although if you throw them with parmesan cheese or mozzarella cheese; I may; just may be okay with it.
Do I think everyone will hate this book? Hell; no.
I for sure know many people will be able to relate and enjoy this book. So donâ€™t feel discouraged to pick this up if you want to. There was nothing wrong; yet everything was wrong for me as a reader.
Do I recommend it? Yes; if you are a usual JG fan and if you are interested in reading more OCD representation.
OCD representation; yes hell yes; I am glad his book exists. Many people could relate; many had this book piercing their heart; so yes I currently think what the hell is wrong with me. I have the theory that I am a robot. So if you have a solution for me please send it my way.
Mr. Green can definitely write and he obviously is very well received by the audiences; if not how will he be a bestseller author; two movies produced based on his books already; heck they are probably even producing this one while I am writing this review. I donâ€™t think there is anything atrocious; I just canâ€™t connect and I feel very much bored while reading his stories. My only exception has been The Fault In Our Stars and his history youtube channel; he has seriously saved me some grades. But anyways letâ€™s not make this personal.
Plot?
Not consistent. It felt like a random stuff put together; finally distracting you from the actual point. I mean this would have been best if we were totally focused on the mental health aspect of the story; but suddenly this bounty hunter stuff was thrown at us; and it didnâ€™t even have a worthy climax or anything. It felt dull.
Characters?
Couldnâ€™t connect with anybody. As a teenager; I always end up with the sensation that I am reading adults (like not only in this book; but pretty much everything John Green has written); and it bothers me.
Aza: I think people who have OCD could relate a lot to her and this whole book; I just couldnâ€™t. But for that; I give 1;000 kudos; the representation a mental illness; but this just doesn't mean I loved this book. I really wanted more than just Azaâ€™s perspective because I felt I couldnâ€™t get anything from the book. Maybe this was the intention; but I basically hated it; because it felt like there was nothing going on or important to remember. She also made me realize I am really getting tired of the whole â€œpsychologist suck they are just pricks who fake listening to usâ€ because fuck I am freaking tired of all YA books not having good mental health help.
Davis: Why did he even exist? I mean I felt he was the manic pixie dream character we always found in John Greenâ€™s characters. I liked he liked poetry; thatâ€™s about it. I honestly couldnâ€™t even feel sorry for him and his dad plot. Yes; I have an ice heart.
Daisy: Mmmmmâ€¦. How can I say this? Oh yeah; I didnâ€™t like her. Again; she just was a terrible friend? As bad as Aza was to her; the fanfic part was too low my dear. Also; I havenâ€™t watch star wars I donâ€™t plan to watch it ever; and I was not the even minimum interested in her freaking Chubaka stories.
Relationship?
Why did it exist? H-O-N-E-S-T-L-Y. Please; someone; explain to me. There wasnâ€™t even palpable attraction to start with; I couldnâ€™t. I donâ€™t even have words because there is basically nothing to talk about.
Writing?
Yeah some cool quotes; but I donâ€™t emotionally connect; I felt bored.I really struggled; 258 pages felt like 1576868 pages.
To not make this review completely negative here are some quotes I will keep. Just know I still regret physically highlighting this book; I want my money back; sigh. If the books were just this quotes it would have probably been 5 stars.
â€œBut I was beginning to learn that your life is a story told.â€
â€œItâ€™s a weird phrase in English; in love; like itâ€™s a sea you drown in or a town you live in. You donâ€™t get to be anything else-in friendship or in anger or in hope. All you can be is in love.â€
â€œI wanted to tell her that I was getting better because that was supposed to be the narrative of the illness: It was a hurdle you jumped over or a battle you won. Illness is a story told in the past.â€
â€œAnd weâ€™re such language-based creatures that to some extent we cannot know what we cannot name. And so we assume it isnâ€™t real. We refer to it with catch-all terms; like crazy or chronic pain; terms that both ostracize and minimize. The term chronic pain captures nothing of the grinding; constant; ceaseless; inescapable hurt. And the term crazy arrives at us with none of the terror or worry you live with. Nor do either of those terms connote the courage people in such pains exemplify; which is why Iâ€™d ask you to frame your mental health around a word other than crazy.â€
This book may have worked if my mental health was horrible; which I don't even know it means something good. (less)",384,NEXTBOOK

I think this is a great activity for book loving spouses!
Partway through this book I thought I was going to give it an ""okay; but didn't really blow me away"" 3 stars. However; I think that the last 3rd of the book really brought things together in an interesting way.
At first; the book seemed like it was trying to be too many things at once. Click here for a video from my Goodreads friend Hannah and go to 7:16 - she does a great job describing how this book is many different things. However; after finishing the book and showing the video to my wife; we agree that whether it is intentional or not; the many different directions this book goes is a great representation of the anxiety of the main character.
Another thing that really raised my enjoyment of this book is that the entirety of the events take place within about 20 minutes of my house. Also; almost every major landmark described in the book can be seen from my office window. When a book hits that close to home; it means a bit more. (view spoiler)
A comparison - tell me if you agree. A John Green teenage conversation:
Girl: My heart is torn asunder with thoughts of my most eloquent yet deeply morose love interest. He is so elegantly handsome; but very humble because:
A. He is an artist
B. He is extremely wealthy but loves the simple things like fast food and independent rock music
C. He is misunderstood
D. Or; because every JG novel has lists!
Boy: You can overcome yourself with my constant caring. I immediately like you and would die for you even though we have nothing in common. Look up into the sky and behold Ursa Major; Casseopea; and Polaris as they cross the zenith of Saturn. Later I will read you the poem I wrote about this inspired by the works of William Shakespeare.
A teenage conversation when I was a teenager.

Anybody can look at you. It's quite rare to find someone who sees the same world you see.
3.5 stars. I haven't been the biggest fan of John Green's stories in the past because I found the characters to be too unrelatable. Like they were just trying too hard at times? But Aza's character felt super realistic and I am so impressed right now. This was honestly one of the best depictions of anxiety or any mental health battle I've ever read. It didn't sound like someone trying to write the concept... John Green has clearly lived this. It was incredibly raw; honest; and beautiful at times.
I think everyone will relate to this on some level because the story grapples with the types of realizations we all face while growing up (so it's kind of reassuring that we're not alone in those thoughts). Aza spends a lot of time examining to what extent we author our lives and what our definition of ""self"" involves. But then she gets stuck in obsessive; infinitely tightening thought spirals that are SO well depicted.
""It's getting sucked into a whirlpool that shrinks and shrinks and shrinks your world until you're just spinning without moving; stuck inside a prison cell that is exactly the size of you; until eventually you realize that you're not actually in a prison cell. You are the prison cell.""
""True terror isn't being scared; it's not having a choice in the matter.""
John Green articulated so many situations and struggles incredibly well. And even though he had his characters muse over how there aren't really ways in English to describe the pain or struggle; he somehow managed to convey it quite vividly.
The book did feel like more of a character study at times; though. The story itself wasn't particularly gripping and I wasn't really that interested in whatever was happening outside of Aza's thoughts. I think it just tried to cover too many different potential plots in less than 300 pages. But the mental health aspect more than made this worth the read! Everything Ava pondered worked together really well to have a larger impact (especially the bits on different parasitic thoughts/beings).
I was grateful that the book didn't talk down to the audience OR get too pretentious while covering some of the fascinating strings of thought. The philosophical conversations were one of my favorite parts because they felt so natural. And the way that the typical ""turtles all the way down"" imagery fit into this particular story was really neat.
I also liked how the book's tone could've easily gotten bleak or tried to put some hollow positive spin on everything; but instead did a great job tackling everything head on in a way that felt really authentic. I am SO glad that this wasn't some cure narrative where Aza gets into a relationship and starts going about life after she's ""better."" She's just living realistically.
""...nothing in this world is deserved except for love; that love is both how you become a person; and why.""
So this wasn't the typical John Green romance with quirky teens; but that ended up being a refreshing change for me. And even though I wasn't terribly into the overall story as a whole; I still really appreciated the depiction of Aza's mental health. Obviously everyone's personal experience is different (so it's not necessarily ""wrong"" if it doesn't speak for you); but I do think this will resonate with a lot of readers!! (less)",386,NEXTBOOK

She's smart and sensitive; and she tries hard to be a good daughter; a good student; and a good friend. But life for Aza isn't what it appears: she struggles every day with invasive thoughts; thoughts which at times leave her unable to focus on nothing but the fear and anxiety they cause.
""It's so weird; to know you're crazy and not be able to do anything about it; you know? It's not like you believe yourself to be normal. You know there is a problem. But you can't figure a way through to fixing it. Because you can't be sure; you know?""
When Aza and her best friend Daisy learn about the disappearance of the town's notorious billionaire; Russell Pickett; the father of one of Aza's childhood friends; they are intrigued by the mystery. And when Daisy learns that there is a $100;000 reward for information leading to Pickett's capture; she convinces Aza to help her investigate. While Aza honestly doesn't care about the money; she's doesn't mind that she gets to be reunited with Davis Pickett; on whom she had a crush when she was younger.
As Davis and Aza grow closer; both struggle with questions about the meaning of life and the true nature of existence. Aza tries to help Davis deal with his feelings of abandonment; whether he even wants his father to return; and what it will mean for him and his younger brother; Noah; since their mother died several years earlier. Davis tries to help Aza by understanding the intensity of her thought spirals; and helping her have the type of relationship she can handle; but as her problems deepen; no one can provide her any comfort.
Turtles All the Way Down is an unblinking look at living with mental illness. There's no candy-coating Aza's feelings; and how helpless and frustrating her illness is for her family and friends. It's also a poignant look at just how much we need love; friendship; acceptance; and understanding; and how debilitating it can be to try and understand the challenges that life throws at us.
There's a point in the book when Daisy tells Aza that someone once said she was like mustard; ""great in small quantities; but then a lot of you is...a lot."" To be honest; while I believe this is an important book; I found it was a little like mustard; and almost relentless. In his quest to give readers a you-are-there feeling where mental illness is concerned; I felt as if John Green sacrificed the book's humor and much of its heart. While Aza and Davis are fascinating characters; I found Daisy tremendously unlikable; while many of the other characters aren't well drawn.
As always; Green's teenage characters are wiser and more erudite than most adults. But that aside; he really shows his storytelling skills when describing Aza's anxiety. Here this paragraph; for example:
""I don't know; like; I'll be at the cafeteria and I'll start thinking about how; like; there are all these things living inside of me that eat my food for me; and how I sort of am them; in a wayâ€”like; I'm not a human person as much as this disgusting; teeming blob of bacteria; and there's not really any getting myself clean; you know; because the dirtiness goes all the way through me. Like; I can't find the deep down part of me that's pure or unsullied or whatever; the part of me where my soul is supposed to be. Which means that I have maybe; like; no more of a soul than the bacteria do.""
I loved loved loved The Fault in Our Stars and really enjoyed Paper Towns ; and I would be lying if I said I didn't hype this book up in my mind. As someone who has struggled with depression and anxiety in my life; and struggled to describe how they make me feel; this book is definitely helpful. I wish I liked it more; but I'm glad I read it. Now maybe I'll go back and read some of his older books.

But I was pleasantly surprised
So Turtles all the way down did have the john green elements i.e.
- Mental health rep
- Tragic characters with tragic backstories
- 16 year old philosophers (it wasnâ€™t so bad in this book)
- Hilarious best friends
- The ending that leaves you VERY unsatisfied
But this book was also unique in its own way in that
- The characters felt more like themselves than fictional impersonators of mr. green
- I thought the OCD was done FANTASTICALLY
- The spiraling of thoughts and emotions and drag that is mental illness was incredible and maybe a little TOO real (but thatâ€™s not a negative in my book)
- The best friend was 10/10 I loved her
- SHE WRITES FANFICTION AND SHES THE FUNNIEST THING SINCE IDEK WHAT
- The romance was kindaâ€¦.quickâ€¦idkâ€¦it was alright; didnâ€™t do anything great for me
- The writing is VERY easy and I was able to read it in less than a day; so thatâ€™s a plus
The thing with john green books is that the endings are done in this cloaked dramatic flair where I feel like heâ€™s either trying to SHOCK the reader or give them an ending that is so realistic is resonates with them; and thatâ€™s cool and all but I just find it to be so â€¦ emptying
Idk how to describe it but I could LOVE the entirety of all his books but the ending is given and then I go to legally change my name to disappointed bc thatâ€™s how I feel
Thereâ€™s just always so much build up to something thatâ€™s just so simple and im like; I understand this isnâ€™t supposed to be some great reveal; we arenâ€™t reading epic fantasy here; but maybe a little something with a twist; or maybe heâ€™s doing too much of a twist; either way; it always hits the â€mehâ€™ for me
I donâ€™t really have much to say beyond that
â€œIt's turtles all the way down;â€ she laughs. â€œIt's turtles all the way fucking down;â€ Daisy agrees

You're trying to find the turtle at the bottom of the pile; but that's not how it works.""
""Because it's turtles all the way down;"" I said again; feeling something akin to a spiritual revelation.â€
my relationship with john green is hit and miss and whether our relationship would end or continue all hinged on this book. folks; I'm pleased to say he's not cancelled yet.
Honestly; this book almost didn't feel like John Green. It does have staple John Green aspects; but at the same time it's very thoughtful; very cohesive; and overall feels more mature. I don't know what's changed between this book and TFIOS; but I really enjoyed the John Green we get in this book. Don't get me wrong: there's still a ridiculous amount of metaphor; simple; hyperbole; analogies; symbolism ect. I just think I happen to like those things. And metaphor is actually one of the only ways to describe what having a mental illness FEELS like.
Turtles All the Way Down follows Aza Holmes; a 16 year old girl who's thrown into the investigation to find a missing billionaire; and is also trying to deal with her OCD. The billionaire plot kind of takes a backseat to the character work - this mostly focusses on Aza's mental health and her struggle with it.
the representation was both the hardest and best thing about this book strong content warnings for this book because some things were kinda triggering; but at the same time the OCD rep is done .. really well. This is ownvoices representation and I think it's pretty clear how much John Green has put into putting forth an authentic and honest book about mental illness. John Green explores stigmatisation of MI; how it can become hard to balance your MI with your relationships; and the feeling of hopelessness when you're dealing with a mental illness that is spiralling out and out of control. I think it was great to see therapy; a positive discussion about medication and also the debunking of the ""mentally ill people make better artists"" trope thing (which sucks)
â€œThoughts are only thoughts. They are not you; you belong to yourself even when your thoughts don't.â€
I also liked the subplots: the romance was nice; and I liked the discussions about privilege/wealth that came up. My favourite subplot was the disappearance of Davies Pickett Senior and how it was affecting his family. Even though this was character driven i liked how these plots played into the story; and I also liked that it was happening and didn't leave Aza as the ""character who IS their MI"" character.
I also just liked how teenage-ery this was. I mean; Aza's best friend Daisy writes shippy Rey/Chewbaccaa star wars fanfiction on AO3 ? And also there's a line that literally says ""he's probably some loser kylo ren stan"" that's fucking hilarious and authentically teen. I really just enjoyed that there was so much fanfiction in this book.
â€œThe thing about a spiral is; if you follow it inward; it never actually ends. It just keeps tightening; infinitely.â€
I just .. really thought this was nice. I thought it was well done. The representation is so so important. Like; guys we don't get good authentic MI rep like this that often. I really enjoyed the characters; I liked the writing and there was some lines and bits I really related to (after a good conversation you don't remember what you talked about; only how it made you feel being one of my favourites)
There was also just ... none of the JG nonsense I didn't want. There was no dramatic romance with a nerd boy desperately trying to attain the girl. It was just .. good. I really enjoyed it so much more than I was expecting and I am going to gladly pick up more of this books in the future. YAY.
â€œYou're both the fire and the water that extinguishes it. You're the narrator; the protagonist; and the sidekick. You're the storyteller and the story told. You are somebody's something; but you are also your you.â€

John Green is one of those authors that always brings the feels. Turtles All the Way Down is a book about mental illness; itâ€™s a book about the power of lifelong friendship; and there is a bit of romance thrown in the mix (though not much).
â€œI would always be like this; always have this within me. There was no beating it. I would never slay the dragon; because the dragon was also me. My self and the disease were knotted together for life.â€
Azaâ€™s story isnâ€™t the easiest to read; and she probably wonâ€™t be a relatable character to all people. There were things about her I could relate to; and I loved her voice. I also adored her friend; Daisy. Their friendship was actually my favorite part of this story. I also liked Azaâ€™s mom and the Davis story-line; even though it wasnâ€™t the focus.
Azaâ€™s story was one that made me think; made me feel; and spoke to me. And itâ€™s one of the first John Green books that didnâ€™t make me cry LOL! I listened to the audio version and enjoyed the narration. Once again; Green writes an unforgettable story with a fantastically flawed leading character. I give this one 4 stars.

It so easily went out of control.
4 1/2 stars. You should go into this book expecting what it is: a slow-moving character portrait filled with complex family dynamics and small-town politics. If you know what this is; like with Ng's Everything I Never Told You; and don't go into it expecting fast-pacing and high-octane drama; you will probably find this quiet read to be extremely engrossing and emotional.
I have to be in the mood for this kind of read; but when I am; it packs a powerful punch. These characters are so vivid; so real; so caught up in the little fires of everyday life in Shaker Heights. There's several stories going on in here; but the book begins with literal fires lighting up the Richardson household and the knowledge that the youngest daughter; Izzy; the wild card; has disappeared. Presumably because she is guilty of the arson.
Then we move back from there. We start to get a portrait of the events leading up to this dramatic fire. We see the poor artist; Mia; and her daughter; Pearl; move into town and the effect they have on all members of the Richardson family. Further back; we get the past stories of almost every character who comes into this book. It is such a rich work in which the personal stories and experiences of secondary characters play a huge part in influencing how events unfold.
And; behind it all; is a court case that will affect all the characters lives. A custody battle over a Chinese baby who could be given every toy; every desire; every opportunity by her rich and white adoptive parents - but is that all? Is that enough when her poor birth mother is ready and willing to care for her? Things become very tense. The town becomes divided. And I felt an emotional wreck by the end of it; too.
Mrs. Richardson; however; could not let Izzy be; and the feeling coalesced in all of them: Izzy pushing; her mother restraining; and after a time no one could remember how the dynamic had started; only that it had existed always.
The Richardson family; along with Mia and Pearl; Bebe; and the McCulloughs; all pulled me into their lives. I despised a character at one point; only to find pity for them a couple of chapters later. The relationship between Izzy and her mother was a real point of interest for me. How Mrs. Richardson's fears about Izzy affected her behaviour toward her; which in turn affected how Izzy behaved. All leading to the ultimate question: was Izzy always what Mrs. Richardson feared she was? Or did Mrs. Richardson create what she most feared through her treatment of Izzy?
Little Fires Everywhere is a great example of how small character dynamics can create a powerful and fascinating story. I love the empathy the author shows for all the people in this book - even the manipulative; morally corrupt and undeserving. No one is merely good or bad. And that is what makes the book so effective. Whose side am I on? I'll let you know if I ever figure it out.

Little Fires Everywhere is such an apt title for a novel that delves into the intricacies and angst that undoubtedly burns through some relationshipsâ€”none more so than mother and daughter. At its core; this story explores the notion that being a mother doesnâ€™t mean being perfect; it comes down to love; sacrifice and sheer will. Through her cast of captivating characters; Celeste Ng confronts the reality that haunts us allâ€”each and every one of us is rife with cracks and flaws; no matter how well we hide it from prying eyes. Thatâ€™s just life.
Itâ€™s akin to pure magic when you pick up a book from an author you havenâ€™t read beforeâ€”I know; whatâ€™s wrong with me? How did I miss Everything I Never Told You?â€”and find yourself caught up in what can only be described as book nirvana. I had heard Celeste Ngâ€™s writing style was incredible; but I took that with a grain of saltâ€”merely an attempt on my part to avoid disappointment. What I didnâ€™t anticipate was this level of character development. This level of intricate detail and the multifaceted beings I wanted nothing more than to surround myself with.
I have to admit; it was Mia that started out as my least favorite of the bunch. Her artsy-fartsy; gypsy-ways came off as incredibly selfish. A mother sacrificing any sense of stability for her daughter; in an attempt to chase her next inspiration; rubbed me the wrong way. How could she not stay in one place and let her incredibly smart daughter thrive?
Then we meet Mrs. Richardson whoâ€™s been hell-bent on living the life she laid out so perfectly in her mind. From most angles she has it allâ€”steady career; lovely home; successful husband; wealth and four children. A conundrum of sorts; sheâ€™s tenacious; but still somehow oblivious. Initially; I wasnâ€™t really sure what to make of her or her motivesâ€”was I reading more into things than I should?
What binds these two very different women together is their teenage children who have their own fires burning between them and a custody battle that rocks their small town. The women end up on opposing sides of the equation; only working to further highlight their differences. The author juxtaposes these two women in many aspectsâ€”but not overtly soâ€”and by the end; I was stunned.
What struck me the most about this journey was the authorâ€™s ability to change my entire perspectiveâ€”meaning; my thoughts and feelings in the beginning of the story were vastly different by the time I turned that final page. Some aspects ended on a sad note; but overall it was still a satisfying ending to what I can only describe as a fully immersive novel.
I had the pleasure of reading this with the Traveling Sisters group; what a fun experience it turned out to be. Celeste Ng gave us plenty to discuss. Looking forward to the next read sisters. â™¥

â€œLittle Fires Everywhereâ€ is my first read by Celeste Ng; but Iâ€™m pretty sure that it wonâ€™t be my last. I could easily have read this book in just one or two sittings but life got in the way (in this case life being a glass of 7up; a knee jerk and â€œNooo! Save the books!â€). But once the book was dry; I picked it up again and didnâ€™t stop until I finished the last page.
Everything in Shaker Heights is planned and there are rules that residents must follow. Houses can only be painted certain colors (to ensure aesthetic harmony); garbage is never put out in front of the house; lawns must always be cut promptly; etc.
The city motto says it all:
â€œMost communities just happen; the best are plannedâ€
When Mia Warren and her fifteen year old daughter; Pearl rent a home from the Richardsons; a prominent Shaker Heights family â€“ their lives will become intertwined in ways they never could have imagined.
Mrs. Richardson liked to rent to people she felt were deserving of her help; people who may have had some tough turns in life. She felt it was her way of giving back. When she first meets Mia Warren and her daughter she thinks they are the perfect tenants.
One of the Richardson boys; Moody is curious about the new tenants and heads over to the rental property. Moody and Pearl hit it off immediately. Moody who has never wanted for anything; is surprised at how this mother and daughter make their way. Mia can stretch a dollar (and leftover food) farther than anyone heâ€™s ever seen. Itâ€™s not long before Moody brings Pearl home to meet everyone. Soon Pearl is spending much of her time at the Richardson home. At first; everything is fantastic. Mrs. Richardson even hires Mia to do some housekeeping and cooking at the Richardson home. But it wonâ€™t be long before the many differences between Mia and Mrs. Richardson cause a divide that will affect the two families in unimaginable ways.
In some ways; I felt bad for Pearl as the nomadic life that her mother had them living would be hard on anyone; especially a teenage girl. However; Pearl also seemed to benefit from the way they lived. At first; Mia came across as incredibly selfish but it wasnâ€™t long before I loved her. Her caring ways were evident and how she responded to the different crises that came up endeared her to me. I may not have agreed with all of her choices but I could certainly see how she would have made them.
Right off the bat I was irked by Mrs. Richardson (the fact that she was rarely referred to by her first name was fitting). Mrs. Richardson was the type who wanted to be seen as someone who cared and helped others. However; you could tell right away that she kept track of all the good things she had done. And you never knew when Mrs. Richardson would want a repayment of her â€œkindnessâ€. When she offers to buy one of Miaâ€™s photographs and Mia doesnâ€™t fall at her feet with gratitude...
â€œThatâ€™s very generous of you.â€ Miaâ€™s eyes slid toward the window briefly and Mrs. Richardson felt a twinge of irritation at this lukewarm response to her philanthropy.
Izzy was a firecracker and I adored her impulsiveness and strong feelings about right and wrong. Even at ten years old; setting shelter cats free â€œTheyâ€™re like prisoners on death rowâ€ ; her refusal to conform was thrilling. Mrs. Pissers and the toothpick incident had me giggling. And I hurried to Google to search â€œThis Be The Verseâ€ by Philip Larkin.
There was a lot going on in â€œLittle Fires Everywhereâ€ but I found it easy to keep up. I will say that it had a bit of a slow start but I feel the author was just setting the stage for all that was to come. And once I hit the halfway mark; I was so completely invested into all of their lives and HAD to know what was going to happen next.
The additional story-line of little Mirabelle McCullough/May Ling Chowâ€™s adoption was incredibly thought provoking and had me asking myself some hard questions. I honestly didnâ€™t know which side I was on half the time. My head was spinning.
â€œWhat made someone a mother? Was it biology alone; or was it love?â€
I thought that the development of the characters was fantastic. With so many characters and only so many pages; it takes skill to bring them all to life. And in my opinion; Celeste Ng did a phenomenal job. And with the many 90â€™s references such as Sir-Mix-a-lot; Smashing Pumpkins; Jerry Springer; and Monica Lewinsky - I was taken back to my own adolescence.
This was an intriguing and compelling domestic drama. A story about motherhood; adolescence; race; rules; right and wrong; and so much more. Great characters and an interesting plot made â€œLittle Fires Everywhereâ€ a fast and fantastic read.

Forever at war with the order of the dark and starlit soul
â€”Adrienne Rich; â€œ8/1/68â€
The nonconformist has always been at war with the suburbsâ€”Adrienne Rich was writing about it 50 years ago; and she surely was not the first. I can understand this dichotomy; I myself have certainly experienced suburbs where a high level of conformity seemed to be expected; resulting in a weird high-school atmosphere among grown adults. Still; you really donâ€™t have to dig very deep to realize that things arenâ€™t as black-and-white as they seem. There are all different kinds of people living everywhere; with varying degrees of happiness and fulfillment. All of which is to say; if youâ€™re going to write on this theme now; you should probably have something new to add to the conversation; or at least a unique way of expressing it.
Little Fires Everywhere takes place in the planned community of Shaker Heights; where an artist named Mia and her teenage daughter Pearl move into a rental home after having lived a peripatetic existence since Pearlâ€™s birth. The battle lines are immediately drawn: the nonconformist; creative Mia versus the staid middle-aged matrons of Shaker Heights. Mind you; these battle lines arenâ€™t initially drawn by the characters; but by the author; who makes it clear that Mia is the moral center of the book. Characters who like Mia are the good characters; characters who donâ€™t like Mia are the bad characters; and characters who are suspicious of Mia at first and then come around to liking her have experienced a redemptive arc. This would be less problematic if Mia hadnâ€™t (view spoiler). I was honestly horrified by Miaâ€™s actions and I wasnâ€™t brought around by the fact that she was an artist; or by the fact that she was allegedly the best mother since the Virgin Mary or whatever. But as far as this book is concerned; Mia is the real deal; an infinitely better person than all those Shaker Heights parents; who; letâ€™s face it; are all kind of repressed. Being repressed is the real sin of suburbanites; you see. Nothing could possibly be worse; I guess. Oh; thereâ€™s also a subplot regarding a custody battle between a set of adoptive white Shaker Heights parents and the babyâ€™s biological mother; a young Chinese immigrant; which could have been really interesting; but itâ€™s given short shrift and is clearly meant only to underscore how amazing Mia is and how horrible the Shaker Heights mothers are in comparison.
Now look; I donâ€™t expect any character to be perfect; and I did not expect that from the character of Mia. Obviously; someone in the novel needed to do something scandalous; or youâ€™d have no book at all. What I donâ€™t like is being told who to root for. I donâ€™t like it when authors stack the deck. Just present every character in the fullness of their humanity and let me decide who Iâ€™m rooting for. If youâ€™ve done your job properly; Iâ€™ll root for who you want me to root for anyway. But if you idealize one extremely flawed character at the expense of everyone else; youâ€™re going to lose me. Youâ€™re going to make me side with a bunch of repressed Shaker Heights matrons I have nothing in common with; because those poor matrons never even had a chance at the end of your pen.
Okay; so the nonconformist versus the suburbs theme wasnâ€™t handled in a particularly original or illuminating way here. Itâ€™s possible the book could have been redeemed by good writing; except Little Fires Everywhere doesnâ€™t really have that either. The constantly shifting viewpoints didnâ€™t work for me at allâ€”and when I say constantly shifting; I donâ€™t mean chapter by chapter. I mean paragraph by paragraph; and sometimes sentence by sentence. This results in some extreme awkwardness; as when every sentence in a paragraph is from the point of view of the character of Izzy; except for one sentence in the middle that relays a piece of information that Izzy doesnâ€™t know. I guess an omniscient narrator is responsible for that particular sentence? In a few instances the omniscient narrator is even more obtrusive; reminding us who does and doesnâ€™t know certain things that have just occurred from one characterâ€™s viewpoint. But beyond the awkwardness; so many characters are given a moment in the spotlight that I never really felt like I got to know most of them; and what we do know is revealed mainly through soliloquies and flashbacks; some of which are so long and involved that they derail the main story and quash any possible shot at narrative momentum. And letâ€™s not forget the eye-rollingly dramatic and implausible plot twists that make it seem as if the author has watched too much Greyâ€™s Anatomy. Thereâ€™s the college student who canâ€™t afford the yearâ€™s tuition; and because sheâ€™s (view spoiler). Thereâ€™s the character who is suspected of (view spoiler) And then thereâ€™s the beloved mentor who is of course (view spoiler) Thereâ€™s just so much crammed into this book; but it all adds up to so little.
This is all very awkward; because a representative of the publisher offered me this ARC a few weeks ago and I enthusiastically accepted. I hadnâ€™t read Celeste Ngâ€™s previous novel; but I was under the impression that she was a good writer and I thought I would really enjoy this one. But I didnâ€™t; and I have to be honest about it; because if Iâ€™m not honest about the books I dislike; I canâ€™t expect anyone to trust my word on any book I review. Little Fires Everywhere seemed endless; it was pedestrian and tedious; and it just regurgitated stereotypes about the suburbs weâ€™ve all heard countless times before. I initially thought I would give it 2 stars because; even though I didnâ€™t like it; it seemed to me that the author had done what sheâ€™d set out to do; and I wanted to acknowledge that. But by the time I reached the end of the book; Iâ€™d changed my mind. It now seems to me that the author truly believes sheâ€™s written something deeply meaningful; and I know this sounds harsh; but I donâ€™t agree. I learned nothing from this book and I didnâ€™t enjoy the experience. Thereâ€™s just no other way to say it. (less)",394,NEXTBOOK

It arrived at 12:01am today. I've been reading non - stop.... a one- sitting read with a few necessity breaks.
Here's is my problem....
I feel as if I've read this story before. I was only mildly interested in many scenes.
There were parts I found trite and parts I found semi boring.
Personally - I found the characters to be very one dimensional.
Here's another problem I have:
Yesterday I finished reading ""In The Fall They Come Back""; by Robert Bausch. I saw a lot of similarities in these two books; but this novel didn't 'wow' me nearly as much.
This story 'seemed' like it had all the elements I usually love .....
The wealthy and thrifty battle it out...plus moral issues to think about ...but my heart wasn't always in it. Not sure why. It could be me.
For one thing..... I spent summers in Shaker Heights .... I felt this book could have been written anywhere. Plus.... I'm not sure I appreciated some of the stereotyping of this community.
BUT ....here's a small flavor of the characters you'll spend time with:
'The Richardson's family':
Bill is an attorney and drives a BMW Sedan
Elena is a wife & mom..... works for the local newspaper: 'Sun Press'. She drives a Lexus
THE FOUR SIBLINGS:
Lexie -senior drives an explorer- has the lead in her School play. Seems fruity & shallow at times - but is an excellent student
Trip - a junior - drives a jeep - loves sports - handsome -fit --and charming
Moody - sophomore- rides a bike ( bless him) - most compassionate- very bright -introspective
Izzy - Freshman- considered black sheep of the bunch - feels different than others in her family.
'The Warren's: They recently moved into a rental ( a duplex) that the Richardsons own.
Mia- 36 years old; single mom; artist. Mia drives a VW Rabbit. She would rather mop floors any day- quietly alone- than have to wait on customers.
Pearl -15 years old - Mia's daughter - shy - honors student -
Paul; my husband; is rushing me - he says RETIRE.... lol.....
So.....I LIKED IT.....but..... after several great books I've recently read; I can't say I'm 'wild' about it. It was ok!!! - alright - better than OK!
Worth reading! Others may love it!

If this book does not get your brain churning; well; then you did read the same book I just did!
This book is filled with so many scenarios with so many questions and no perfect answers. Every situation is a little pile of kindling and any of the questionable solutions will only ignite the fire . . . soon you have a bunch of fires ready to burn everything to the ground. Man; that would be a great title for this book! Oh . . . wait . . .
It has been a long time since I remember reading a book where my mind and problem solving skills have been this challenged. Usually when you are reading you think; ""well; the best route for them to follow is this"" or ""Geez; it's obvious that they should never have done that."" In this book I just kept thinking; ""I am glad I am not the one who has to make any of these decisions!""
Also; this book is full of so many misunderstandings. I get frustrated when someone is falsely accused or the wrong conclusion is assumed. Every 15 minutes I found myself yelling at this book!
""IT WASN'T HER!""
""NO; THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED! SOMEONE SPEAK UP!""
""OH; THIS ISN'T GOING TO END WELL!""
I believe I have said it before; but any time a book has you engaged so much you yell at it; want to pull the characters out of the pages and shake them; and/or need a stiff drink to calm your nerves at the end of each chapter; you are reading a pretty darn good book.
Give your analytical side a gift and read this book - it would be a great one for a book club. I imagine it would certainly lead to some lively discussion! (less)",396,NEXTBOOK

(I know; it's killing me; too.)
Sometimes one of my greatest frustrations with books I read is that it is difficult for me to believe that a character would do something egregious as a knee-jerk reaction to something they don't agree with. I know; I'm reading fiction; which isn't always directly based on real life; but sometimes a character's actions are so ridiculous and ring so false that they really change my feelings about a book.
Other times a character is so unlikable (although you may discover it's all an act) that they're just so off-putting; and they detract from the book's appeal.
Both things happened for me while reading Celeste Ng's new book; Little Fires Everywhere ; and I'm so disappointed; because I wanted to love it. While I found much of the book simply beautiful; the plotâ€”and one characterâ€”travel down a path that I found a little too far-fetched and irritating that it spoiled how I felt.
To someone on the outside looking in; the Richardson family seems like the quintessential Shaker Heights; Ohio familyâ€”two successful and driven parents; four good-looking children; sure to follow in their parents' footsteps. The perception isn't all falseâ€”Elena Richardson; who returned to her hometown after college to raise a family; is a reporter for the local paper; her husband is a successful attorney. Their children; each one year apart; are each popular and successful in their own way; except the youngest; Izzy; who has a knack for standing out; especially if it means pushing her mother's buttons.
When Mia Warren; an enigmatic; slightly bohemian artist; and her daughter Pearl arrive in Shaker Heights; and move into the Richardsons' rental apartment; the family quickly falls under their spell. Pearl; who has moved more times than she can count; always on her mother's whim; has finally extracted a promise from Mia that they will stay in Shaker Heights; and she is excited to finally be able to make friends and cement relationships instead of biding her time until she leaves town again.
Pearl and the Richardsons' younger son; Moody; become close friends; although quickly she becomes a part of the family. Mia; too; in addition to working on her art; begins working for the Richardsons; becoming an unexpected confidante for older daughter Lexie; and forging a relationship with Izzy that she can't have with her mother. But Mia is also wary of the Richardsons and doesn't quite trust that all is as perfect as it seems.
When a custody battle involving one of Elena's oldest friends becomes fodder for the media; everyone in town has an opinion. Elena discovers that she and Mia are on opposite sides of this fight; which causes Elena to view Mia with suspicion. Suddenly she feels the need to find more about this mysterious woman who holds her family in her thrall; and Elena doesn't realizeâ€”or care; reallyâ€”about what damage the truth may cause; for everyone.
""All her life; she had learned that passion; like fire; was a dangerous thing. It so easily went out of control. It scaled walls and jumped over trenches. Sparks leapt like fleas and spread as rapidly; a breeze could carry embers for miles. Better to control that spark and pass it carefully from one generation to the next; like an Olympic torch. Or; perhaps; to tend it carefully like an eternal flame: a reminder of light and goodness that would neverâ€”could neverâ€”set anything ablaze. Carefully controlled. Domesticated. Happy in captivity. The key; she thought; was to avoid conflagration.""
Little Fires Everywhere is a powerful meditation on motherhood and the sometimes-tenuous bond between mother and child. It's also a book about the destructive power of secrets; misunderstandings; and miscommunication; and how easily problems could be avoided if people would just say what they thought; or speak up rather than let a person roll over them. At its most poignant; this is a book about the damage that can be done by neglect or mistreatment; even when it's unintended; and how finding someone who seems to care about you can be a life-changing force.
Ng is a storyteller with such quiet power. As she did in her spectacular first novel; Everything I Never Told You ; she captures the routine and dramatic moments in a family's life; uncovering just how much goes on underneath the silences. While I appreciate her fearlessness in creating unappealing characters; I really was unhappy with some of her choices; which I won't reveal for fear of spoiling the plot; but they just seemed so ludicrous (and in one case; just a wee bit convenient and predictable) that one character and her treatment of others became almost one-dimensional.
I've seen many glowingly positive reviews of this book; so I wouldn't let my criticisms dissuade you from reading it if it interests you. Ng is an immense talent; and I look forward to seeing what's next for her. If you do read this; I would love to talk to you after you're finished; to see what you thought about the things that frustrated me.

We all do things we regret now and then. You just have to carry them with you.â€
Never in my life have I read any book; any narrative; that cared as deeply for all of its characters as this one did. Little Fires Everywhere lives in the grey area; leaving it impossible not to be invested; impossible not to love every character and cry for every character and root for every character; despite all their flaws.
I really struggle to characterize this book; itâ€™s sort of a combination between a mystery and literary fiction; and will probably work best for you if youâ€™re a fan of both? Little Fires Everywhere is a very slow-burn story about a small town thrown into disarray by a court dispute. When an Asian baby given up by her mother is adopted by a white family; it causes a spiral of events that lead to a scene of a house on fire and a family driven away.
I think Iâ€™ve already expressed this; but this book is.... a masterpiece. Itâ€™s one of those books that I finished and then was just on my bed tearing up because itâ€™s so well-crafted. The reason this book is so fantastic is primarily structural; we see the end; and then we go back and see the beginning.
But anyway; the reason this book works so well is the characterization. There is so much to appreciate here. I like that Moody is sort of written as the stereotypical jilted nice guy; and and then we see more nuance to that characterization. I loved the complexity of the dynamic between poor characters and rich characters; I loved how no character is black and white; but they have definition nonetheless.
Of the approximately-eleven-person main cast; Izzy is my absolute favorite. Izzy is a ridiculously relatable character for me personally mainly through her relationship with her mom. Thereâ€™s a line somewhere where Izzy says she thinks her mother sees her as such a demon that all her actions are framed in that light - that was me. And that is still me in my relationship with one of my parents. The degree to which the narrative of this book validates her trauma and her feelings is incredible.
And on another very personal note; Miaâ€¦ kind of reminds me of my other parent. So some of you who follow me on this platform might now that my mom and I are really; really close; and I grew up with her as my main support system. And I thinkâ€¦ her relationship with Izzy just felt so personal to me for that reason.
So maybe this was too personal a read for me; but Iâ€™m going to be honest: itâ€™s my belief that reading is something that is meant to be personal. And maybe the degree to which this personally affected me is the most important part of all.
Thereâ€™s a scene within this book that has stuck with me since the beginning; in which the adoptive mother of the baby is asked how she plans to incorporate Chinese culture into the life of the baby; and she brings up â€œoriental rugsâ€ and how she gives the baby rice. And itâ€™s this awful moment; because we know she loves that baby. We do. But in that moment she becomes the persecutor of her own child. She does not understand; and so she perpetrates a culture that has been trying to swallow up her child. I think thatâ€™s what this book is about; in the end; the degrees to which we can hurt people without ever attempting to; the way we can ruin lives through looking for our own happiness.
This book was masterful. And I hope you all read it.

Ng's writing was so beautiful; her characters so real; and the story so compelling. I instantly knew I would be reading whatever she put out next.
Three years later and I'm happy to say that Ng has returned with just as stunning of a novel as her debut. Little Fires Everywhere is hands down one of the best books I've read this year; and just like its predecessor will be rising to the top of my yearly favorites list.
I don't want to say too much about this novel because with Ng's books; I've discovered; it's best to go in anticipating very little and being surprised along the way. Because she is very good at surprisesâ€”and not the kind of plot twists you'll read in a thriller or spy novel; the kind of surprises that sneak up on you in real life and seem to tear your world apart. Her novels are domestic; but they aren't quaint. They have a raw; emotional power to them that are especially drawn out by her incredibly crafted characters. The inner turmoil is just as important as the external conflict in her stories; and that makes for a compulsively readable; yet immensely relatable read. You can empathize with so many parties in her stories; and this one is no exception.
To me; these characters jumped from the pages; they have the mannerism (she's so observant; akin to Adichie in that sense) and the motivations of people you know in your own life. Mrs. Richardson's ethics and worldview are as real and as contrary as Mia's artistic sentiments. And you can't help feeling for both of them at times. That's what makes this story so goodâ€”there is no black and white; despite the obviously drawn lines between the differing characters. Ng exists in the grey; and her mission; it seems to me; is to pull you in to the grey too and think about how murky and complicated and messy life is.
I'll stop gushing; but only as long as people go pick this up and read it (along with her first novel too)! Ng is surely one of my favorite living writers; and; again; I can't wait to see what she does next. (less)",399,NEXTBOOK

Based on more than 60% of the content; this is young adult material. Itâ€™s good; parts are excellent; others not so much.
I liked Miaâ€™s backstory as she became an artist using experimental photography. I thought that the custody dispute concerning â€œOriental Barbieâ€ was worth at least a star or two.
A lot of the characters are clichÃ©d. The at-home Mr. Richardson could be a cardboard cutout with excellent earning skills. He fairs a lot better before the judge. The Richardson children fit into â€œThe Breakfast Clubâ€ well. A jock; a popular girl; a smart kid and Izzy who may well be a transgendered Holden Caulfield (thank you to my GR friend; Bill Kupersmith); but I liked her a lot more than that wretched boy.
So yeah; the Richardsonâ€™s have a child for each grade in high-school. Mrs. Richardson produced four singletons in roughly as many years. While in other respects; she is a perfect match for her orderly and rule-bound community. The rapid-fire baby production seemed reckless and out of place. It is the only part of her character that jibbed with aggressively investigating her tenant and employeeâ€™s past. Opening a â€can of wormsâ€™ and a house full of screaming babies being equally disordered and unpredictable.
I donâ€™t believe that she is meant to be likable. She approaches friendship with same calculation as Claire Underwood with a careful tally of every kindness. But; as she is central to the book; I wish she were plausible. Even if she were perfectly constructed; the story is still awfully scattered.
My son heard part of the book while we were driving over the holidays. When we stopped; he would say â€œSoâ€ and give a one-sentence summary of the upcoming section or chapter. I donâ€™t believe he has any preternatural gifts as plot savant. A lot of the story is pretty predictable.
I have a quibble about that car. Is that the same VW rabbit Miaâ€™s brother bought when they were teenagers? If so; how did she manage vehicle maintenance on minimum wage earnings supplemented by occasionally selling a piece of art? Twenty to thirty years of use is aging NASA spacecraft territory; but this car starts reliably; runs well over long distances; and doesnâ€™t need any repairs. It seems oddly out of place given the careful mathematics of Bebeâ€™s poverty.

I would give it 100 if Goodreads would let me.
Little Fires Everywhere is a novel that far surpasses any other that I have ever read. I don't know how Celeste Ng did it. It is a brilliantly written novel with intricate; rich and wholly vivid characters whose lives are so fully intertwined you can't help but read on in bewildered awe of how Celeste Ng created these characters. My nerve endings were fully engaged on high alert from the first sentence.
Shaker Heights; Ohio is an affluent town with rules and regulations like no other. Mrs. Richardson lives by them; having been raised by them and she has raised her four children (Lexie; Trip; Moody and Izzy) to abide by them as well. She rents a little apartment in Shaker Heights to Mia Warren and her daughter Pearl; who are less fortunate. Mia is a free spirited artist; who lives life to the fullest. These women have one thing in common and one thing only: they love their children immensely and they accept each other's as their own. Mia (or rather Ms. Ng) describes it beautifully:
""To a parent; your child wasn't just a person; your child was a place; a kind of Narnia; a vast eternal place where the present you were living and the past you remembered and the future you longed for all existed at once. You could see it every time you looked at her; layered in her face was the baby she'd been and the child she'd become and the adult she would grow up to be and you saw them all simultaneously; like a 3-D image. It made your head spin. It was like a place you could take refuge; if you knew how to get in. And each time you left it; each time your child passed out of your sight; you feared you might never be able to return to that place again.""
Neither live perfect lives; sometimes in fact they make grave mistakes; yet their love for their children never falters.
These mothers relationships with each other; their family and everyone in town is threatened when a custody battle ensues between a friend of the Richardsons; Mrs. and Mr. McCullough; who are in the middle of adopting a Chinese American baby and a friend of Mia's; Bebe; who is the birth mother. This battle wrecks havoc on the town and causes incredible strife between the families.
This novel is captivating and crazy compelling. These characters burn an indelible image onto your soul. The character of Izzy; Mrs. Richardson's daughter had me from the beginning (kind of like Hannah from Ms. Ng's Everything I Never Told You - which I also loved). Izzy has a strength and over came odds that most children in her position wouldn't. Her triumphs made my heart soar.
Somehow Ms. Ng made me change my mind about some of the characters throughout the course of this novel. In the beginning; I felt one way about two of the characters and then by the end; I did a complete switcheroo; and my feelings about them were FIERCE.
Little Fires everywhere brought forth laughter and lots of tears. It is that kind of novel. I can't recommend it highly enough. It is captivating; compelling and full of heart and soul. Celeste Ng's ability to intertwine the characters and storylines was wondrous; brilliant and beautiful. I loved every second of this book. It has now topped my list as my FAVORITE BOOK of ALL TIME.
Little Fires Everywhere was a Traveling Sister Group Read and included Brenda; Norma; Jennifer; Holly; Melissa & Kendall. We all had a fabulous time reading this one together - the group discussions for this incredible read were amazing and I look forward to our next read together.

Pearl moves with her itinerant artist mother; Mia; into a rental house owned by the Richardsons in Shaker Heights and becomes infatuated with this family; their house; their life style so different from her own and is mostly infatuated with three of the teenage siblings. The reader though knows from the get go that there's no perfection here . An awful thing happens to this family and we know what it is from the first sentence but I won't give it away.
The Shaker Heights motto is: ""Most communities just happen; the best are planned "" : the underlying philosophy being that everything could - and should- be planned out; and that by doing so you could avoid the unseemly; the unpleasant; and the disastrous."" The truth is that life happens and no matter what - things cannot be avoided and what happens here defies this underlying philosophy.
But this is not the most awful thing that happens in this family. For me it was the dysfunctional relationship that Elena has with her youngest daughter Izzy . Izzy reminds me in some ways of Hannah in Ng's last book; Everything I Never Told You. Unlike Hannah; Izzy is not invisible not totally ignored; but she is picked on; made fun of and seems to always be the recipient of her mother's impatience with things that are not perfect. Theirs is not the only mother-daughter relationship that Ng focuses on . There is Mia and Pearl; who move from place to place; with Pearl not knowing the reason why or who her father was. There is Bebe; Mia's coworker; and her newborn baby May-Ling that she abandons and then fights to get custody. Bebe's story at first seems secondary but it ends up being the impetus for Elena's almost obsessive search to find out Mia's past.
Ng delves deep into her characters and you feel you know them inside and out even though it takes until the end to fully understand Elena and Izzy. You may not like all of them but you will understand them . This I find to be Ng's strength as a writer- how she makes us know her characters. One of the most poignant scenes in the novel; is when the Richardsons find the photographs that Mia leaves for them. She came to know them too . Definitely recommended to those who were fans of Everything I Never Told You; and stories of families who are less than perfect; which I'm sure many of us can relate to.

Each parent thinks theyâ€™re doing the right things in the way they raise their children. But who truly is?
Ng does a good job of bringing each character to life. Izzy is the most unique of the characters. And the relationship between Izzy and Mrs. Richardson is spot on perfect. â€œWhen it came to Izzy; Mrs. Richardson was seldom calm; and for that matter; Izzy herself never was.â€
There are multiple storylines here; all equally fascinating. The one that grabbed me the most was between Bebe Chow and the McCulloughs. I flip flopped back and forth between whose side I was on. The heartache of both sides was palpable.
It took a while for the book to truly grab me. But once it did; it really did. The title is so apt. Not just the physical fire; but the fires that burn within the characters; especially the fire that ignited in Mrs. Richardson.
Itâ€™s interesting that the author refers to Mrs. Richardson by her formal name; whereas everyone else is called by their first name. It suits her perfectly; as she is such a stickler for tradition and following the rules.
This is a fascinating book with a lot going for it. Five rich stars!

Mrs. Richardson prides herself on always following the rules; believing if this is done success in life and family will follow. She has four children ; but as we know saying it doesn't make it so. Mia; a single mother; has a secret; a secret that will be used to her detriment. She was my favorite character; has a better; closer bond with her daughter; Pearl; but mother's know; teenage daughter keep secrets too. A friend of Mrs Richardson; is unable to have children; but is given an opportunity that may not be hers to take.
What an absolutely perfect title this was; small fires trailing these characters in their actions; words and the things they keep hidden. The way the story progresses; unravels; is brilliant; completely right. The different lifestyles; but always at heart is the question; ""Nature vs. nurture; does lifestyle matter if the love is strong?"" Unbreakable bonds; forged in many different ways. Sometimes by the time we have full realization of something important; it may be too late.
This novel does something important; it makes one think; might make some open their eyes. Would be an excellent choice for a book group of woman. Much to discuss here.

When unconventional artist Mia and her fifteen year old daughter; Pearl; move to Shaker Heights; Ohio their lives dramatically change. Of even great significance is their impact on the seemingly perfect Richardson family. On the surface; the Richardsonâ€™s seem to have it all--perfect house; perfect jobs; perfect children (minus one); but something is missing. Living in the bubble of the cookie cutter community of Shaker Heights; their world is insular and small. Mia and Pearlâ€™s presence shakes them to the core and opens them up to a world of new possibilities.
Told through the eyes of multiple characters; this is a slow burn read with fluid changes of POV. While one of the main events occurs in the first chapter; it isn't until the end that one can fully understand the implications of ""the little fires everywhere.""
Hereâ€™s the thing--when I first started reading this; I had a hard time connecting to the characters and the plot. Several times I wanted to give up and start another book; but Ngâ€™s beautiful writing kept pulling me back in. It wasnâ€™t until about half way through; I felt the subtle spark of connection; and as it grew my feelings about this book grew. When I got to the end; I was simply stunned by how this book snuck up on me and overpowered my emotions. To sum up my reading experience: â€œAnd it was complicated; what had happened. It was a terribly awkward agonizingly slow; painfully intimate story that unfolded.â€

Shaker Heights; Cleveland is an idyllic place to live; everything has been planned to create the perfect community; but it's residents are expected to live by its many rules and regulations.
The Richardson's are quintessentially the kind of family who the community of Shaker Heights was built for. Elena Richardson was brought up with these rules; and she and her husband are determined that their four children; Lexie; Trip; Moody and Izzy will live by them too. Izzy isn't exactly a chip off the old block though; and will prove to be very disruptive.
The Richardson's rent out an apartment to people they feel need a helping hand; and their latest tenants are Mia and her daughter Pearl. Mia is a free spirit; an artist specialising in photography; and when Elenaâ€™s troublesome daughter Izzy becomes close to Mia; Elena finds that she's jealous of the relationship; a relationship that doesn't exist between her and Izzy. Further to this; an adoption case in the community puts Elena and Mia on opposing sides; and Elena decides to do some digging on Miaâ€™s past; and uproots some secrets that will change everything.
Oh gosh; this book explores so many issues; but for me the one that stood out was motherhood; and in particular; the relationship between mothers and daughters; from baby's early days to teenage angst.
It was beautifully written; with characters so well developed I felt as if I knew them personally. I also liked the setting of Shaker Heights; a place so perfect and orderly; and yet; ultimately there is always someone who will rip up those precious rules and regulations and throw them in the garbage.
Celeste Ng writes with great insight and empathy; and leaves the reader with much to think about.

Then just as the smoke becomes a raging inferno; the story has gotten under your skin and you've inhaled more than you thought and instead of it going to your lungs; it aims straight for the heart.
It's a story of relationships - Mother daughter ones. It starts off with Mia and daughter; Pearl; who move to shaker heights which is an upscale suburban neighbourhood where life is both homogenous and idyllic. Until the adoption of a Chinese baby leaves the community divided. Is it biology that makes a parent? The old argument of nature vs nurture. Or what about decisions that are made in the heat of the moment that become life defining for a child; as regrettable as they may be; should a parent get a 2nd chance?
Ng raises some tough moral questions. Ones that had me thinking and arguing in my own head of what is right; wrong and sometimes not negotiable.

A smart; but often scathing look at entitlement coupled with the endless dynamic layers between mother and child.
The Clinton era gets a sharp examination as we drop in on Shaker Heights; an ideal suburban community with plenty of unspoken rules for its financially comfortable residents. The Richardson family is the prototype of the community; with Elena Richardson embracing the lifestyle with unparalleled enthusiasm.
â€Perfection: that was the goal; and perhaps the Shakers had lived it so strongly it had seeped into the soil itself; feeding those who grew up there with a propensity to overachieve and a deep intolerance for flaws.â€™
By contrast; Mrs. Richardsonâ€™s new tenants; Mia and her daughter; Pearl; live a free spirited; nomadic life. Mia is a photographer; who works just enough to afford the basics in life. Pearl; though; has no trouble adapting to the stable home life of the Richardsonâ€™s; practically becoming a member of the family.
Things are working out well enough; until a chain of events unlocks long buried secrets; spawning a bitter custody battle; which exposes cracks in the Richardsonâ€™s perfect image; and will culminate in a fiery inferno; both physically and metaphorically.
This second novel by Celeste Ng is not quite as grim or heavy as her debut; but it is every bit as provocative.
I have had a hard time writing this review because the layers in this story are many; with so many themes to explore. I have worked on it for days; feeling slightly intimidated; unable to find the words that would do justice to such an outstanding novel.
|
This book adeptly explores hot button issues prevalent twenty years ago; between episodes of Jerry Springer and Clintonâ€™s sex scandals; when a different set of questions were raised; such as interracial adoptions.
â€œIt came; over and over; down to this: What made someone a mother? Was it biology alone; or was it love?â€
I was impressed with the various contrasts presented in the book; which included the mindset of the privileged juxtaposed against those who find themselves at their mercy. Was there an exacting price for that privilege and was it worth it? I must say; the judgmental hypocrisy is astounding!!
But; the heartbeat of the story is centered around motherhood. Every mother represented exposed that instant vulnerability motherhood creates. The pain of infertility and the frustrating process of adoption is examined right along with parental sacrifices and foibles and their consequences.
Mia and Mrs. Richardson's children also play an integral part in the story; their roles intertwined and connected in the most ironic of ways.
â€Izzy had the heart of a radical; but she had the experience of a fourteen-year-old in the suburban Midwest.â€™
One of the more interesting character studies is of Elena- mostly referred to as Mrs. Richardson; which I thought was a very clever way of hammering home a specific point. Her cluelessness; her arrogance; and relentless reproach is extraordinary in light of what is actually taking place.
Mia; in turn; may spark a little resentfulness in Mrs. Richardson; and despite my initial puzzlement about her; and I admit I certainly questioned some of her choices; I ended up respecting her a great deal.
So; as you can see; the novel is very driven by the characters; each offering a different perspective or new avenue in which to view the situation. Sometimes I felt deep empathy for one character; feeling the acuteness of their pain; but unable to choose a side. It is often heart wrenching and I found myself feeling torn on many occasions.
On other occasions; I had a very hard time mustering up any real empathy for a few of these characters.
The plotting was very tightly woven and on several occasions; I may have uttered an expletive out loud when misunderstandings exploded in the worst possible way; creating a mountain of tension in the process.
This is a very compelling family drama; drawing out a bit of nostalgia; prompting me to take a closer look in the mirror; to put myself in the place of others before passing judgement.
But; I also picked up on a bit of sarcasm here and there; almost as if the author was scoffing at some of the attitudes or the mindset of the era; although it was done so in an understated and sly way.
Itâ€™s been nearly a week since I finished the book and I still find myself mulling over the many layers and angles; and thinking about the characters and the choices they made and how it all came together in the end.
So; it is fair to say; this book has had an impact on me; and think it is a novel anyone who appreciates a well written; thought provoking work of fiction will appreciate. Highly recommend!!

I didn't hate this book at first; rather; the dislike gradually seeped up on me; like Little Gripes Everywhere! My admired GR friend Debbie uses the concept of a Complaint Board in her wonderful reviews; and I really had the Complaint Board experience with this one. It was as though I was standing in front of that bulletin board at the Whole Foods where people are all like; ""NO COCONUT CHIA PODS PAST TWO WEEKS WTF!"" Only for me it was more like; ""THIS IS MASQUERADING AS A CHARACTER-DRIVEN NOVEL WHEN IT'S REALLY PLOT-DRIVEN AF WHAT THE HELL?""
So; initially I had decided to keep my negative Nellie thoughts to myself; but I'll share a couple...lest they become everything I never told you (lol lol!)
Gripe 1: What I said on the Complaint Board above: I think by literary fiction standards; this book was way too concerned with jerking the plot around in different directions and became clunky and mechanical in so doing. As other reviews have observed; this also often relies on the reader having to swallow repeated farfetched coincidences; which I will not enumerate to avoid spoilers; and also because they are annoying and absurd.
Gripe 2: Related: Now; I liked Everything I Never Told You (the first book I ever reviewed on Goodreads! And very positively!) and would definitely call that a character-driven novel; which by definition requires very well-developed characters. The reader needs a very clear understanding of not just the things a character is doing or has done; but more importantly; what the character is thinking and how they are thinking it - and as they alone are capable of thinking.
In my opinion; in contrast; LFE is only a character-driven novel if you accept as the definition of a character-driven novel ""a novel with some characters in it; who do some stuff."" I didn't find the voices - internal or external - differentiated at all. I feel like I could read aloud a quote or a thought from each character and it would be difficult to guess who it was. Everyone was super superficially portrayed: the four kids were a kind of Breakfast Club cast of characters without any of the John Hughes wit; etc.
Gripe 3: Some other reviewers have already noted that they felt manipulated by the book; that it seemed clear that the author was yanking around the puppet strings in order to gesture toward whom the reader was supposed to like; dislike; and root for. I would have to agree with this; I felt that the author should have trusted us more instead of nudging us in different directions - for example; by phoning it in with the characterization of certain characters so that they have all the subtlety of Cruella de Ville. I was also really put off by the whole Manic Pixie Dream Artist Mom thing going on with Mia; whom; as many others have noted; seems to be set up as the hero of the book. And ugh; the ending; with the four envelopes - for me that was so saccharine that I seriously wanted to vomit.
In short - wow; I really liked this author's first book; and this one was so different and really suffered in comparison. It really felt like a sophomore slump to me; or an early draft. Her debut was pretty risky and daring; while this one sort of played it safe to the point of becoming formulaic. Reading this book often felt to me like trying to play dolls with a young child and having to just unquestioningly accept the illogical and despotic rules of their universe.
Side note: It didn't help that I read The Leavers recently - check that one out for a more complex and nuanced examination of issues around cross-cultural adoption. And for your more general making-peace-with mom issues (among many other things); The Animators is another suggestion I'd offer. A richer depiction of artists as well - some manic maybe; but manic pixie-free! (less)",410,NEXTBOOK

I have read SO many wonderful books lately; I keep thinking I canâ€™t rate all these books 5 stars... but then I think how can I not? They all definitely deserve it! SO here I go again with another gushing review!(Currently Iâ€™m reading a book Iâ€™m not all that crazy about; so I promise a slightly negative review to come‰)
What makes you a mother biology or love?
This book was about the bonds between mothers and their children; The relationship between mothers and daughters in particular.... I have a daughter and of course I am a daughter; so I do realize how complicated this relationship can be; even in a somewhat stable environment....
The mothers in this book were all very different from one another; but the thing they had in common is that they all truly love their children.... even if they didnâ€™t always do a good job of showing it.... I believe all these women were so well developed as characters; and even if you didnâ€™t agree with their actions you could understand their motivation.... this book really touched on quite a few issues; and I donâ€™t want to mention them in this review; because I donâ€™t want to ruin the journey for you; but it sure did make me think.... Think what would I do in that same situation? Itâ€™s hard to say; of course Iâ€™d like to think Iâ€™d always do the right thing; but then that begs the question what is the right thing? Sometimes Iâ€™m not sure if it is as clear cut as that.....
The only part of this book that I had an opinion on(OK not the only thing I had an opinion on; but the only thing Iâ€™m going to share in this review); because it was very personal for me was the court case.... as I have mentioned previously I am the only biological child in a family of adoptive brotherâ€™s (I never got a sister!) And all my brothers are of a different race/ethnicity from me.... I donâ€™t believe I could have loved my brothers anymore had they been biologically related to me; and I donâ€™t believe they ever felt robbed of their culture.... so do I think a white family can raise a Chinese girl? Absolutely! But this is because of personal experience; I grew up in a house with cross-cultural adoption and it was a positive experience.... do I think a biological mother should be given a second chance after abandoning her baby? That Iâ€™m not sure about....*** steps off soapbox ***
Looking back on this book I think I like it even more.... every character in this book was so well developed; by the end you felt as though you knew these people.... I also think the story was so well plotted how everything unfolded was perfect.... and even though the ending was quite heartbreaking; it just made the book that much better...
Definitely strongly recommend! And I hope you enjoy the journey!’•

Celeste Ngâ€™s writing style wasnâ€™t super easy to read. I feel the need to stress that Little Fires Everywhere is not a fast-paced; easy to read suburban thriller. Itâ€™s a slow-paced novel of fiction that focuses on American suburbia and middle class ethics that often requires more attention when reading to make sure you pick up on every subtle detail.

Not at first. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s interesting. In the beginning; everyone looked the same to me. Everyone *felt* the same. I had trouble distinguishing characters from one another.
But then I started learning about their pasts and began to see people in a different light. Mia Warren; for instance; is extremely secretive. She isolates herself on purpose and moves from place to place on a regular basis. She doesnâ€™t need much. All she really needs is Pearl and her art. I only knew what everyone knew about her â€“ which wasnâ€™t much.
So you can imagine my shock when I discovered what Mia Warren was running from. That is not what I expected. But I liked it. Sometimes we meet people who have their guards up and see how unwilling they are to share information about their lives and we think; â€â€My God; that person is stuck-up.â€™â€™
And then; suddenly; opportunity arises for us to truly learn something about them and we begin to realize that people are more complicated than that.
Although; what I liked most about this book was actually the narration. The characters slowly go from zero to eight/nine as the story progresses; but the narration held my attention for the entire reading time. It was never manipulative. The subject matter is extremely delicate and controversial (whether a child should stay with her biological but poor and single mother or be handed to a rich; loving couple); and yet; I honestly considered both sides.
The author never says what is right or wrong â€“ she describes what is happening; but she doesnâ€™t tell us how to feel. The characters do the talking and many points of view are provided so that we are not forced to feel a certain way.
Even now; Iâ€™m not sure I could answer the question this book raises about the child in a definitive way. But I sure enjoyed the discussions around it.
Itâ€™s a slow book; thatâ€™s true. It took me longer than Iâ€™m willing to admit to read it; but itâ€™s a worthwhile ride.

i honestly wasnt expecting to enjoy this book. i didnt really like celeste ngs debut and i thought this was probably overhyped. but this is one of the few occasions where i am actually happy to admit i was wrong.
i knew from the first chapter; where the title comes into play; that i was in for a real treat. if you dont know by now; i love when a book is so aptly named. sometimes titles can come across as lazy or appear as an afterthought; so there is nothing i love more than when a title is given some meaning and depth. and this book did that perfectly.
i love how this book explored so many themes - such as motherhood; race; friendship; community; children - each one a little fire that slowly burned into an explosion of a story. i thought ng was so clever in how she likened so many topics to a fire; bright with a burning intensity and heat. but with fire and scorched earth can come new beginnings. izzys character was definitely the highlight for me. i loved seeing her come to accept this idea and burn her own way; blazing a path of her own choosing.
i know this wont be a book for everyone due to its slow pace and prominent focus on character histories; but there is definitely a reason this book is so highly rated. and i am very relieved that i enjoyed such a great work of fiction.

I regret not reading it sooner.
What happens when two characters with very different personalities converge? A captivating story.
On one corner we have Elena Richardson; a successful; married reporter with four children who live in a well-to-do neighborhood; she has planned out carefully her life and executed it meticulously.
On the other corner we have Mia Warren; an enigmatic; creative; single artist and her daughter Pearl who at the beginning of the story rented an apartment from Mrs. Richardson.
Soon these two families start interacting and what follows is a journey you have to take by yourself.
The story is told from different points of view and it alternates between the past and present. Celeste Ng (pronounced ""ing"") has brilliantly written this book; everything is excellent from the characters to the writing. I have become a fan.
Overall; I loved this book. It is one of the best novels I've read.

I don't know. I didn't like this book; but I feel like I should. Ng is a phenomenal writer but I just couldn't get into this book. The first chapter was amazing and I thought I was in for something special.
There was a clear theme of ignorance in the ""progressive"" town of Shaker Heights that only outsiders and Izzy could see. The reason I couldn't get into this book was that all the supporting characters felt a little thin. Like they weren't actually people; they were just there to show how ignorant and selfish the people of Shaker Heights were.
Mia was obviously a fantastic character and had multiple chapters dedicated to her backstory and why she became the artist she was/why she had the feelings about the central conflict that she had. By the end of the story it felt like there really wasn't a choice. Mia's side was clearly in the right and the Richardsons and the McCulloughs were too ignorant to ever really support. I don't know. I know there are people like them in the world. I know why this book is so popular and it deserves the success it's had.

It finally dawned on me that Little Fires Everywhere inexplicably reminded me of a childhood favorite book called The Saturdays by Elizabeth Enright.
Both books feature families of four rambunctious kids and Celeste Ng writes in a confident; animated manner that is reminiscent of Elizabeth Enright's style. The books each have more of an infectious; rather than addictive quality. It is so fun to be in the middle of these families and root for one character and then feel sympathy for another.
Although this is only Ng's second book; she has an established formula that she successfully works again. Instead of starting out with a death as she did in Everything I Never Told You; this time Ng starts out with the mystery of who set the house afire and works back telling the story of tangled adult relationships and secret lives of teenagers. Also; as in her first book; there are hints of simmering racism in the comfortable suburban utopia that is Shaker Heights; Ohio.
As I sit here dissecting the various themes of Little Fires Everywhere (and there are many!); the one that stands out the most to me is motherhood. What does it mean to be a mother? How much can we control the direction of our children's lives? What rights; privileges; assumptions do we make about our kids? Finally; do we actually OWN the child that is borne to us? Ng expertly explores all the complicated angles of mother and child relationships.
I had been anxiously waiting for this book since the day I finished Ng's first one. I embraced that first book and held onto it; pushing it onto friends; even into hands of complete strangers. It struck me as absolutely insightful and that TWIST ending! Everything I Never Told You is a proud member of my Twister Hall of Fame at http://www.booksbejeweled.com
I just don't get that overwhelming feeling of LOVE for this book. Ng is a carefully organized; brilliant writer and sometimes as a reader; I start to feel used; taken advantage of. Every minor character; every little event in the story is absolutely constructed and placed to maximum effect. And that gets a bit tiresome; I feel like Ng is telling me how to feel. However; all small grievances; it keeps me from giving it a five star rating.
The audiobook performance by Jennifer Lim is one of the best I have ever listened to- and I listen a lot! I highly recommend the audiobook; I think Ng's writing is well suited to an audio. (less)",417,NEXTBOOK

Celeste Ng certainly knows how to start a story! ""Everyone in Shaker Heights was talking about it that summer: how Isabelle; the last of the Richardson children; had finally gone around the bend and burned the house down."" The town was already on edge because of a controversial adoption case; but now the Richardsons' family drama has given them something new to talk about. What's going on behind closed doors in this perfect suburban community? How did they get to this point?
But the problem with rules; he reflected; was that they implied a right way and a wrong way to do things. When; in fact; most of the time there were simply ways; none of them quite wrong or quite right; and nothing to tell you for sure which side of the line you stood on.
The story is set in the 1990s in Shaker Heights; a planned suburban community near Cleveland; Ohio. To give an idea of the community's atmosphere; I had the Weeds theme song stuck in my head as I was reading! Rules dictate everything in the tight-knit community. There's one way to do things and little patience for those who take a different path. Many of the residents tend to judge people within the bubble of their own experiences; such as when they unfairly judge the competence of a waitress by their 9-to-5 standards. Their ""color-blindness"" allows them to be oblivious to things in plain sight; such as their own biases or the subtly different treatment of those who are different. At one point; white Lexie's black boyfriend has to explain to her how differently they will be judged individually for the same mistake. Some members of the community have a difficult time understanding that not everyone lives like they do or that there's value in different ways of life. There's also a recurrent attitude of entitlement: the feeling that those with more financial stability are more entitled to a child or Elena Richardson's entitlement to peoples' secrets and other compensation in exchange for her ""charity."" The progressive community members mean well; but they recoil when the work of righting injustice gets too messy or rowdy. Elena Richardson is terrified that everything will spin out of control if things aren't done within the established order: ""Rules existed for a reason: if you followed them; you would succeed; if you didnâ€™t; you might burn the world to the ground."" Elena fears an inferno; but maybe a clean slate is what her family and community need.
Passion; like fire; was a dangerous thing. It so easily went out of control. It scaled walls and jumped over trenches. Sparks leapt like fleas and spread as rapidly; a breeze could carry embers for miles. Better to control that spark and pass it carefully from one generation to the next; like an Olympic torch. Or; perhaps; to tend it carefully like an eternal flame: a reminder of light and goodness that would neverâ€”could neverâ€”set anything ablaze. Carefully controlled. Domesticated. Happy in captivity. The key; she thought; was to avoid conflagration.
Ng's writing captivates me so much because of her astute observations of human behavior. She has a way of capturing complex feelings and those seemingly innocent little gestures and facial expressions that are actually incredibly revealing. The omniscient narrator slips into the minds of all the characters; so we get to know all of her characters intimately. We meet the Richardson family first. Elena Richardson writes for the local newspaper. Journalism is a perfect outlet for her because she can ""do good within the system."" The dad; a lawyer; exists in the background; but he remembers a time when Elena was passionate about changing things for the better. It's why he fell in love with her. Comfortable suburban life has quelled Elena's flame and made them complacent. My favorite part was the dynamics between the Richardson teens! Each teen has a distinct personality: warm Lexie (18); charming Trip (17); sensitive Moody (15); and self-righteous Izzy (14). I loved the scenes where we got to see each of their specific responses to an event. There were parts that I could relate to as one of four siblings; especially since the younger three are a year apart. The scene of the Richardsons watching their house burn down as they sat in birth order actually made me smile; because we still sit in that exact same configuration after three decades!
Everything; she noticed; seemed capable of transmogrification. Anything had the potential to transform; and this; to her; seemed the true meaning of art.
When Mia and Pearl (15) move into the Richardson's rental property; everything begins to change. Elena is intrigued by Mia; but uneasy with her disregard for the established order. Mia's rebelliousness awakens something uncomfortable inside of Elena that she would rather keep locked up. The Warrens have lived a completely different life than the Richardsons. While the Richardsons have a stable life in Shaker Heights; the Warrens have moved 46 times in Pearl's lifetime. It's always just been her and her mother traveling around the country in a VW Rabbit. As Pearl gets to know the Richardson teens; she wonders where all of their confidence comes from. She can't imagine what it's like to feel grounded; ""to have such a deep taproot in a single place; to be immersed in it so thoroughly that it had steeped into every fiber of your being."" As Pearl becomes infatuated with the Richardson family; the Richardson kids grow increasingly fascinated by Mia. Rebellious Izzy becomes especially obsessed with her. Mia is the first person that makes her realize she has the power to change things.
Everything had nuance; everything had an unrevealed side or unexplored depths. Everything was worth looking at more closely.
Feelings and opinions can become so internalized that we forget what sparked them in the first place. People that remind us of things we are trying to forget or don't want to see can trigger an automatic revulsion. Some characters have experiences that make them empathetic (Lexie). Other characters' beliefs become more rigid because of past pain; their emotional closeness to a situation clouds their perspective (Moody; Elena). I loved the explanation for Elena's confrontational relationship with Izzy; how her ""resentment began to sheathe concern"" and ""anger is fearâ€™s bodyguard."" Feelings can become so permanently ingrained that it can be hard to step back and see things clearly. Sometimes a significant emotional experience is the only thing that can snap us out of our complacency.
â€œMost of the time; everyone deserves more than one chance. We all do things we regret; now and then. You just have to carry them with you.â€
The story gets off to a slow start because of the character introductions and the focus on the teenagers; but I was still completely engrossed in their lives. It really took off for me when the adoption plot starts about one-third of the way through; especially in relation to Mia's backstory. There are so many interesting questions raised: Is it biology or love that makes a parent? How important is the role of cultural heritage in upbringing? But by the end; I felt like the author played favorites with the characters. For all the focus on complexity and gray areas; sometimes it felt too simplistic. Elena got more one-dimensional as the story went on. The adoptive parents were treated with such tenderness at first; but by the time the trial rolled around I kept having to remind myself that hadn't literally snatched the child out of the biological mother's arms. I love the feeling of having my sympathies pulled in a million directions; but here I felt reflexive resistance as my sympathies were yanked to one side. The scales tipped towards Mia a little too much and my contrarian side started rearing its ugly head. Mia is often described as enlightened and empathetic; but she's just as flawed as anyone else. Mia's selfishness and hypocrisy are not as emphasized as Elena's flaws and she got off extremely easy compared to other characters. It's not that I don't understand her actions; but there were issues regarding parental rights and the importance of family bonds that I wanted to see Mia wrestle with more directly.
Sometimes you need to scorch everything to the ground; and start over. After the burning the soil is richer; and new things can grow. People are like that; too. They start over. They find a way.
The arrival of Mia and Pearl Warren is the spark that sets of series of little conflicts that culminates in the Richardson's house being set ablaze; but there was already plenty of fuel to feed the flames. Despite the best-laid plans; things don't always go the way we expect. Mrs. Richardson thinks she prepared her kids for life so well that they will never get into tough situations and they will always make the ""right"" decisions; but life is more complicated than that. Sometimes people don't realize how affecting the consequences of their actions will be; because of lack of experience or circumstances beyond their control. Situations are never as clear-cut as they look from the outside. There are so many instances in this book when people make snap judgments based on an incomplete picture. Uncharitable; simplistic assumptions are made when there are actually complex; relatable explanations. As I read; I was reminded of a Stephen M.R. Covey quote: ""We judge ourselves by our intentions and everyone else by their actions."" I didn't fall in love with Little Fires Everywhere as much as Everything I Never Told You; but it's still a captivating and thought-provoking sophomore novel. I just didn't get everything I wanted from the wrap-up; perhaps because I was most interested in the adoption storyline.
If you liked this book; you might enjoy The Leavers by Lisa Ko. It also deals with the complexities of interracial adoption. It was a full four-star book for me; though I must say that I preferred Mia's photography career over Deming/Daniel's struggling music career!

I've been putting off writing my review....and rethinking my rating on LITTLE FIRES EVERYWHERE bc it just didn't blow me away like it did so many others; and I really wanted time to think about it....What am I missing? It's just kind of a soap opera really and nothing we haven't heard before. One family with teens who make mistakes (one big one) and a busy-body mother who thinks she's better than everybody. Another mother who makes a big mistake bc of hopelessness...(yes; very sad). Two well-to-do couples who long to have a child....and another mother who continually drags her daughter around the country running from her past. Ok; I admit Mia and Pearl's story was a good one....the best of the novel actually....but overall the whole shebang was just a bit better than average for me....and honestly....forgettable.
....In THE FIRST HALF; we meet some of the characters....the Richardson family; their four children; a few of their teen friends plus Mia and daughter Pearl who have just moved to town.
....AND; I do know I'm in a MAJOR minority here; but Whew! I was pretty much bored throughout a good portion up to this point. I felt like I kept reading and reading without making any progress in the lives of the young adults; but as I said; that was just in THE FIRST HALF.
....In THE SECOND HALF; the plot thickens and I did become more engaged. We meet a few more characters and discover secrets....learn more about Mia's past; her family; her education; her love of photography as well as her deep love and devotion for her brother Warren and daughter Pearl. We also meet the McCullough's and Ryan's who long to start a family; and a struggling immigrant mother who makes a heartbreaking decision.
No doubt here; Celeste Ng is a gifted writer. Her debut offering EVERYTHING I NEVER TOLD YOU is still my favorite of her novels. LITTLE FIRES EVERYWHERE pretty much fit into the average plus category for me. I know; I know....it won the 2017 Goodread's Best Fiction Award. (inching out my personal favorite BEARTOWN) but nonetheless; my congratulations to a talented author....really! Ok; Whew! I got that off my chest!

While beautifully written; emotional and intense - Little Fires Everywhere didn't blow me away as much as I expected it would. It was a slow-burn book that required your investment and I have to admit to skimming some pages because they felt long.
The story for me was about more than the storyline though that was certainly interesting. What resonated with me was Ng's depiction of relationships. The relationships between mothers and their children; the relationships between friends; the relationships between siblings and the complicated relationships between family members. Ng powerfully explored these relationships and wasn't afraid to showcase how at times we seem to hurt those we love the most because of our own unhappiness; apprehension or feelings of inadequacy. I loved how flawed and real the relationships were in this novel.
Another standout for me was the exploration of motherhood. In Elena Richardson and Mia Warren we see two polar opposite mothers. Elena very rigid; proper; opinionated and the epitome of success within her town. Mia with her bohemian lifestyle was in contrast artsy; free and openly loving. Their lives would intertwine when Mia and her daughter Pearl rent an apartment from the Richardson's. Pearl becomes smitten with the Richardson's children and their life. Izzy; the youngest Richardson child; in turn becomes smitten with Mia. Each child essentially finds something they are missing in the other family. For Mia it is an open acceptance; understanding and love. For Pearl who was an only child; always on the move - it is a house full of siblings with more things than they could ever need.
This is a story that unfolds as the lives of the characters unravel. The characters were well written and complex. They all had layers to them; that were skillfully peeled away as Ng skillfully weaves her story. ""Weaves"" is the perfect word here as the story is connected by a host of characters and linked through many different relationships and actions. We see why they behave the way they do; we come to understand their actions even if they are wrong.
Overall; this book was very definitely enjoyable. I wholeheartedly enjoyed the explorations into the characters. I was simply never wowed by it so while I enjoyed it; I didn't love it. I think the slowness of the book coupled with a busy week might not have been the best time to delve into such a slow burner but I am happy that I read it. (less)",420,NEXTBOOK

Unfortunately; the only thing that came to mind was weeping in terror.
What an absolute dork. I love him so much â™¥
Honestly; Apollo is hands down my favourite character that Riordan has ever created. I know all of these books have the same light; humourous tone; but none of the others seem to make me laugh so much. Apollo is just so sassy and snarky; and his disdain for humans rings with hilarious truth.
I think I like these Apollo stories so much more because they feel the most unique. Many of the other voices - e.g. Percy Jackson and Magnus Chase - started to blend together after a little while; and their characters were hard to distinguish from one another. And the plots of the other books seemed to move in similar cycles of prophecy-quest-resolution; whereas this and The Hidden Oracle contained more surprises.
Did I mention that it's full of laughs?
""Oh!"" I said. ""Um...nah."" I leaned against the wall; hoping to look casual; attractive and suave. Unfortunately; I missed the wall.
Also; I just kind of love that Apollo is a narcissistic ass. Don't get me wrong; I praised the Percy Jackson series for being all about how a seemingly regular kid discovers he is actually so much more and proceeds to become a hero. This is a great message. But sometimes there is just something so delightful about a character who is definitely NOT a hero and doesn't even pretend to be.
In this book; Apollo has left Camp Half-Blood behind and is venturing out to restore Oracles and - hopefully - regain his place on Mount Olympus after Zeus cast him out and made him human. It is full of adventure; haiku and mechanical dragons; as well as some great LGBTQ+ representation (Apollo is; himself; bisexual). I can't wait for more.
Quick note: there are spoilers for the Percy Jackson books; so maybe don't read this if you haven't read them yet.

This was a completely fabulous sequel to The Hidden Oracle! Although I didn't like it quite as much because (A) it wasn't as hilarious; although still funny; and (B) the plot wasn't as exciting and twisty as the first one. But it was still an entirely solid read for me and I think I'm half in love with Apollo -- who is a DORK and narcissist and but what can you do. He's adorable.
I think Apollo's character development is just so fabulous. He's still 100% full of himself and really surprised when the world doesn't revolve around him (this happens to the best of us tbh); but he keeps getting more and more loyal to his demigod companions. And he's utter trash for looking after Meg. And; on occasion; he might even do something self-sacrificial instead of letting everyone else perish in his wake. #lovely I do hate how they ALWAYS give him a rough time though!! I mean; I get it...he's was horrible god. But like he tries so hard and Meg is so mean to him and Calypso and Leo give him 500% a rough time. Althoooooough. That is also what friends are for. And everyone they meet blames him for EVERYTHING. It's actually surprising that he stays in such good spirits about his own godliness when he's cleaning toilets and peeling carrots.
I'm still waiting to warm up to Meg though??? I wasn't really invested in her in book #1; and she just continues to be a rude little turnip. I suppose it's meant to be endearing??? I find the actual root vegetable more endearing. I guess I'm a fan of manners and kindness; both of which Meg is allergic to.
GREAT THINGS TO EXPECT:
â€¢ the unexpected; because seriously you have no idea what this book is going to throw at you next
â€¢ gods on facebook
â€¢ monsters; murder; and mayhem
â€¢ booby traps
â€¢ prophecies that nearly kill you
â€¢ tofu
â€¢ mechanical dragons that are designed like lego
â€¢ a house that only shows you the rooms it wants to and expands when requested
â€¢ griffins
â€¢ featuring f/f parent couple
â€¢ bisexual Apollo
â€¢ sass
â€¢ fighting
â€¢ SASSSSSSSSSS
I laughed so much omg. The lines are HYSTERICAL and I think Apollo's tendency to use ""god like speech"" but then mesh it with modern pop-culture references and narcissistic haikus is just the best thing since cupcakes were invented. I am such a fan omg. He's got a relaly different voice to Percy Jackson too; which is GREAT.
And I also love how the structure of these books are less like the PJO books. They're on an adventure that continually unravels; so it's not the same-old-same-old plot set up (get a prophecy; assemble a team; go on a quest; nearly die; etc.) of the PJO books. It's just a bit refreshing and sets them apart.
BUT SHOULD YOU BE READING APOLLO IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE PERCY JACKSON BOOKS? Erm. No. There are spoilers for the Percy books. And even that aside; you wouldn't get a lot of the references/characters.
ALL IN ALL: this was definitely a hilariously glorious sequel! Maybe it wasn't as fast moving or exciting as other Halfblood books; and maaaaybe it dragged a bit in the middle. But it was still funny and used a LOT of the more obscure Greek myths so I was forced to learn things. How dare it. I'm definitely a huge fan of Apollo!! 10/10 will recommend giving Apollo a cookie and perhaps a break; but also it's hilarious to watch him suffer through being a human.
*** QUOTES ***
I tried to think of a brilliant plan. Unfortunately; the only thing that came to mind was weeping in terror.
I wondered if Meg knew that [names redacted] had been beheaded for letting her escape. I decided not to mention it. If Meg was really curious; she could check their Facebook status updates.
""Commodus blames me for his death;"" I said.
""Why?"" Meg asked.
""Probably because I killed him.""
""Ah."" Leo nodded sagely. ""That would do it.
""No sweat;"" Leo said. ""I'll handle the first two hundred or so myself; then if I get tired--""
""Leo; stop."" Calypso gave Emmie an apologetic frown. ""He jokes more when he's nervous. He also jokes worse when he's nervous.""
""I have no idea what you're talking about."" Leo inserted carrot fangs into his mouth and snarled.
Meg almost choked on her stir-fry.
""Oh!"" I said. ""Um...nah."" I leaned against the wall; hoping to look casual; attractive and suave. Unfortunately; I missed the wall.
My eyelids fluttered open. I sat up; groaning. When you are the sun god; it's a rare treat to be able to sleep late. Now here I was; a mere mortal; and people kept waking me up at the crack of dawn. I'd spent millennia being the crack of dawn. I was tired of it.

UPDATE: On further reflection I've decided to add a handy guide to help you get through this wait. Here are some steps I recommend from experience:
-Obsessively re-read The Hidden Oracle
-Obsessively re-read the Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus series
-Obsessively re-read every single thing Rick Riordan has ever written
-Repeat three steps above
-Scour the internet for interesting and exciting theories about this book
-Read many; many fanfics of the Trials of Apollo
-Write many; many fanfics of the Trials of Apollo
-Enjoy a brief respite when Magnus Chase and the Hammer of Thor comes out
-Freak out when you see the cover for The Dark Prophecy when it's released
-Freak out when you read the excerpt when it's released
-Continuously repeat steps 1-3

I hysterically laughed my ass off while I was reading this book on the BTS. The Dark Prophecy picks up after what happened in The Hidden Oracle. Lester; aka Apollo; teamed up with Leo and his girlfriend and comes to Indianapolis to pursue the prophecy he was bestowed. The tone of this book is as good as the first book but the pace is quite slow. Apollo reminded me of Deadpool talking with readers with his sarcastic tone. His development is promiment and what I have expected. His attitude is frivolous as always; you know; but it's the point of this series why it's so much differrent from the Percy Jackson series despite the fact that it's sharing the same world-building.
Leo; on the other hand; is a solid character in this book. Although he is oafish at times; he still got my attention as he did in The Heroes of Olympus. Moreover; the emperor; Commodus; is exactly a narcissistic character that I almost died of laughing; and I think he might be my favorite villain of all time. Meg is one of the best protagonists I've ever seen. From the first half of this book; I thought her character was such a typical heroine; and I had no idea how wrong I was until the very end of this book. She's so intricate !
â€œHe looked like a hallucinating ballerina in boxer shorts;â€
The griffins are excellent that (view spoiler) However; sometimes I didn't get what Lester were talking about; I knew it's all his music or rhyme; but it's also one of the reasons why I didn't enjoy this fully.
The ending of this led me to the long wait for the next book. Yet I have a gut feeling it's gonna be as exciting as the fourth book of the Percy Jackson series.
â€œBeing productive. Ugh. It's such a human concept. It implies you have limited time (LOL) and have to work hard to make something happen (double LOL).â€

This is the 12th book I have read by him and I read the previous eleven books almost in row. And the thought of any regret didn't even pass before me.
Well; for this book it was much better than the last one. It was more gripping and more interesting. The only thing which was missing here was Percbeth!! Annabeth didn't even appear in the last one. She is helping her relative or something....WHATEVER! I really want PERCBETH IN THE NEXT BOOK!
Itâ€™s not how long you live that matters. Itâ€™s what you live for.
I loved Apollo! His sense of humour is unique in the entire series. He is changing. But I was enjoying his whining more than this. Anyway; I don't mind how he is doing.
>>The scene of revelation of Prophecy here was the best. I loved that.
>>In the Blood of Olympus; I was glad that Leo had rescued Calypso. And I was really looking forward to their proper relationship here. But in this book; the spark that should have been in their relationship was drastically missing. I didn't feel liking this ship the way I liked in Heros of Olympus series.
>>And...wow! One of my favourite characters from Percy Jackson and the Olympians series is BACK!!!!! Wowowowowow!! Can't wait. Not a chance after the interpretation of the Prophecy.
Regardless of the fact; this book follows the formula of previous books; regardless of it being very predictable (at least for me); regardless of everything; I enjoyed this book. How can you not LOL at his humor? He's got a powerful tool to enchant his readers. And that is freakin' humor!
P.S
So; this is the last book I have read for now. I won't be reading novels for a little long time in future because I am getting very busy. Exams; studies..you know. But I will be reading comics and short stories in this time as they are very short and less addictive than novels. *something is better than nothing*

""I; the most important passenger; the youth who had once been the glorious god Apollo; was forced to sit in the back of the dragon.""
More than once while reading I've had to ponder: Am I getting too old for Percy Jackson? That thought filled me with such terror I had to drink from my Butterbeer cup and gaze up at my wall of Taylor Swift posters to confirm that; yes; I was a stinkin'no-good millennial who blows her money on stupid shit instead helping the economy.
But as I read on; I realized the problem wasn't meâ€”well; not all me anywayâ€”it's Apollo. I can't stand the whiny human-god. He was great in small doses like with the previous series; but being in his head for 300+ pages is agonizing. All he does is complain about how great he used to be; then sulk about his powerlessness.
I felt like going Kaz Brekker on his assâ€”""You think you know what pain looks like? Then he would paint a picture for them using his fists."" Obviously; this is a very subjective opinion. Lots of reviewers adore Apollo; some actually preferring this series over its predecessors because of him.
Stale jokes asideâ€”I didn't laugh out loud once while readingâ€”the other wonderful stoutheart primary character we're supposed to root for is Meg. Rude; bratty; crude Meg.
I am in no way putting down her character arc. I think it's awesome that her relationship with Nero represents a soft abusiveness; one based on emotional manipulation and attacking her self-esteem instead of hard fists; and lots of kids and younger teens will be able to relate and learn from it. But as an adult-in-training; I feel it could have been written with more finesse. Basically I've read better.
And someone needs to teach Riordan how to properly withhold information without stabbing a big red flag in the narrative soil every time. It was like that in the Heroes of Olympus series; too. A character would think of something foreboding; then right when readers are about to see what the object it; the train of thought snaps off as the characters resolutely thinks; ""It can't be THAT monster/Thinking about THAT monster will just make me more scared."" Here; the monster's identity is concealed by the Rule of Voldemortâ€”if you say his name; he can and will track you down.
There are positives. Thumbs up for diversity in the form of lesbian parents; Apollo's bisexuality/pansexuality; and fleshing out token minorities. The Hidden Oracle; while retaining many of these features; didn't quite handle it as well; so yay improvement!
(view spoiler)
I'll continue the series because Riordan is the self-deprecating love I keep running back to; but my expectations will remain at a reasonable height below my ankle socks.

""As long as gods shall live; so long shall I love you"".
Tras sobrevirir al desastre del OrÃ¡culo de Dodona y a la traiciÃ³n de Meg; Apolo debe seguir con su misiÃ³n de hacer que los demÃ¡s OrÃ¡culos funcionen; se restauren las comunicaciones entre los semidioses y el malvado Triunvirato Romano no se apodere del mundo mortal. Ahora; con la ayuda de Leo (YAY!) y Calypso; Apolo tiene que viajar a IndianÃ¡polis; lugar donde las fuerzas perversas del Segundo Emperador se estÃ¡n reuniendo para controlar el OrÃ¡culo Oscuro; para salvar a antiguos conocidos y escuchar la ProfecÃ­a Oscura que los guiarÃ¡ en sus aventuras.
De todos los personajes que han aparecido en los libros de Rick Riordan; Apolo es de mis favoritos. En su condiciÃ³n de mortal como Lester Papadopoulos y sin ningÃºn tipo de entrenamiento de batalla; Apolo como narrador de la historia es un genio. Sigue deleitÃ¡ndonos con sus comentarios de ex-dios; sus haiku malÃ­simos; sus chistes ÃoÃos y su mala memoria. Es imposible no leer La ProfecÃ­a Oscura sin reÃ­rse un poco; a pesar de todas las tragedias por las que pasan los personajes.
Ahora; imagÃ­nense un libro en el que Apolo y Leo Valdez interactÃºan. Â¡Oro puro! Nada mÃ¡s que decir.
En esta segunda entrega de Las Pruebas de Apolo; Rick Riordan nos adentra mucho mÃ¡s en la mitologÃ­a romana; en los ires y venires de Apolo miles de aÃos atrÃ¡s y nos presenta nuevos personajes que aprenderemos a querer. Jo; Emmie; Litierses; Georgie e incluso una pareja de grifos se volverÃ¡n partes vitales de la historia. De La ProfecÃ­a Oscura me gustÃ³ muchÃ­simo que Rick Riordan nos muestra que Apolo; incluso en su condiciÃ³n anterior de dios; cometiÃ³ muchÃ­simos errores e injusticias que; ahora; milenios despuÃ©s; vienen a acecharlo y a cobrarle.
En este libro; a diferencia de en El OrÃ¡culo Oculto; Apolo tiene mucho mÃ¡s los pies en la tierra y asume que debe ganarse de nuevo su inmortalidad por Ã©l mismo; pues si bien tiene amigos como Leo; Calypso y Meg; los mÃ©ritos debe ganÃ¡rselos con el sudor de su espalda. Y asÃ­ lo hace; en este libro Apolo toma muchÃ­simo mÃ¡s las riendas de las situaciones y empieza a actuar no sÃ³lo preocupÃ¡ndose por sÃ­ mismo; sino preocupÃ¡ndose por los demÃ¡s y sacrificÃ¡ndose si es necesario.
La ProfecÃ­a Oscura es un libro lleno de venganzas; explosiones; muertes; segundas oportunidades y momentos de redenciÃ³n. Con la profecÃ­a que nuestros hÃ©roes obtienen al final; Rick Riordan abre el camino a siguientes libros mÃ¡s complejos; con mÃ¡s peligros; poderes recuperados y reencuentros de personajes que extraÃamos muchÃ­simo de otras sagas.

You know when you're in the middle of watching a YouTube video and a thirty second ad interrupts that just about ruins the whole video? Yeah; that's how it felt when Riordan decided to throw some of his political views into this book.
The worst part is this book is for kids. Children are reading this. Children as young as eight should not be subject to adult matters - such as a lesbian couple; which this book promoted in chapter six.
Would people be okay if someone wrote about a drag queen in a children's book? What if child characters went to a strip club? No? Then why; I ask; is it okay to put a lesbian couple; portray two women living together; and promote your own shameless political agenda; in a book meant for young; easily impressionable minds?
Whether you support the LGBT+ community or not is beside the point. People have the right to hold whatever opinions they want. But I think all adult matters should be kept out of kids' entertainment; and it's horrible when adults try to sneak it in because they think it's ""funny"" or they're trying to push their own personal agenda.
War; alcoholism; suicide; sex; prostitution; or any other adult things should not be put in children's books. Adults keep those topics away from children for a reason - they're too much for them to handle. And I don't think sexual identification should be put in children's books either; when the young minds reading them haven't even begun to develop sexually yet.
Look; my whole problem wasn't even that there were gay characters in this book. My problem was that Riordan was so obviously including them just for the sake of ""representation."" Representation of different groups is a great thing; and I love when I come across a genuinely diverse bookâ€¦ but when the author is trying so hard to make their book diverse to earn brownie points; it comes across as unnatural and takes away from the story.
Anyway; the gay thing is so overdone by now it's getting ridiculous. It's one thing when you have an actual gay character like Radu from And I Darken and it makes sense for them to be gay. But when you throw in a gay character just to get your LGBT+ brownie points and they're only in the book for; like; two seconds? If I were gay; I would be insulted by this ""representation.""
Please; move on to something new. (less)",437,NEXTBOOK

I was a little disappointed because one of my favorite aspects of book one was that Apollo interacted with his kids; and I was fully expecting a couple of them to join him on this quest (namely Will with Nico tagging along). And while I did get familiar faces none of his kids joined him.
However; many new characters are introduced who I grew to like. Then we have one of my babies who finally returned. (view spoiler) Meg returns of course and she's grown on me even more in this book. Actually; one of my favorite aspects of this book was Apollo and Meg's friendship. Different from book one in which all Meg does is boss Apollo around they have evolved into a camaraderie where they work together. Meg will still sometimes say a command; but it's not out of cruelty or punishment. Apollo genuinely cares about Meg; and vice versa; and having them protect one another warms my heart.
And Apollo; oh man; you're still so egotistical and funny. He's the tiniest bit less self-centered; but he still mostly believes the world revolves around him. I think it's because he's used to riding the sun chariot; and the Earth revolves around the sun (and therefore him). Still he shows compassion. He has regrets and cares for those around him.
The quest in this book; while interesting; was not one of my favorites. The next quest seems like it will be more entertaining. Especially because we'll get to see even more of my babies! (view spoiler) (less)",440,NEXTBOOK

Iâ€™d like Rick Riordan to write my life please. Is that possible? Pretty please with karpos thrown peaches on top? His writing is so captivating and I know that technically itâ€™s aimed at a slightly younger audience than me but like sorry what? Didnâ€™t hear you over how much I bloody adore the mythological world heâ€™s created.
Apollo remains to be such a walking; talking; wonderful contradiction. But heâ€™s working on it; going from a god to a spotty mortal teen; slowly coming to terms with that and growing to be a better person. His character development is most prominent in his friendship with Leo and Calypso- going from merely putting up with them and arguing with Cal at every turn; to tearing up when talking about leaving them (not that heâ€™d admit it; though). Also; his eventual understanding that mortal lives are worth a hell of a lot more than he (and all the other gods) give them credit for. Whoâ€™d have thought he would go from the Apollo he was at the start of the series to the Apollo who willingly offers himself as a sacrifice multiple times in order to save Meg; whatta babe.
Can we please talk about Leo and Cal: I know Iâ€™m always a sucker for cute couples; but thereâ€™s something about these two that just makes me feel so happy. I guess itâ€™s because throughout the seriesâ€™ weâ€™ve got to know them so well; but every little moment with Leo made me smile because he !! deserves !! the !! world !! Heâ€™s such a sweetheart; and the thought of him and Cal being looked after at the Waystation; going to school and getting to live slightly more normal lives feels so bloody right. What could be more fulfilling in a story than a fire boy; his magical island girlfriend; and his giant bronze dragon living happily and safely?! Thatâ€™s all I ask; Riordan; all I ask.
Lityerses may be one of my new favourite characters; which probably sounds a bit weird; but I love a good redemption-and-second-chance type character; and to be quite honest I even liked him before he turned on Commodus. What can I say; I always end up loving the villains. Emmie and Jo are the absolute sweetest; I adore the fact that they are these gentle badasses; with their gentle badass little girl (who shares a name with me; making her the most powerful and brilliant character in the book in my eyes; duh); and honestly I kinda want to go and live with them in the Waystation; looking after griffins and living my best life. I adored Apolloâ€™s understanding of the abuse Meg suffered from Nero; his handling of it was so soft and important and I love how he doesnâ€™t rush her at any point- it truly is about her wellbeing and working on her trust and beliefs; and itâ€™s just so carefully and well put together.
The action was pretty much nonstop; there were no dull parts; nothing I would consider to be filler; and I really enjoyed reading it. Thereâ€™s something so incredibly fun about Riordanâ€™s writing; and I always come out of it feeling so enriched with knowledge about mythology and excited to read more. Grover reappearing at the end genuinely made me sit up and squeal (really loudly; much to my sleeping catâ€™s surprise); Iâ€™m currently waiting for my copy of the next book to arrive in the post so Iâ€™m pondering over who I think the third emperor could be; and thinking of ways that Commodus will appear again (Iâ€™m thinking heâ€™s going to just randomly jump out from under a table screaming bloody murder at some point; so I guess weâ€™ll see). Iâ€™m just so ridiculously enthralled in Apolloâ€™s trials; and I canâ€™t wait to start the next book. Hopefully uni reading doesn't get in the way; because I'm so invested in Apollo and I'll be real sad if I end up not finishing this series for months (@ the gods: please let uni reading be fairly painless k thx bye).

Amo la fluidez de los capÃ­tulos; las aventuras nunca se perciben aburridas y ninguno de los nuevos personajes me pasÃ³ indiferente. Y la naturalidad con la que representa la comunidad LGBT es un punto extra.

It's one of those things in life you thought you really didn't need until it enters your life and proves you completely wrong. Then; you vociferously realize that you need more of it; NOW.
In a world where hatred; suffering; and oppression seem to proliferate exponentially (at least in the news; no thanks to the orange cheeto occupying the white house and his enablers in the house and senate); this book is a much-needed tonic of unbridled laughter; sass; and joy. The book is low-stakes (in terms of stress) while being completely unpredictable. Again; didn't realize how much I needed that.
It is no secret that Rick Riordan has a magical gift for writing characters that one learns to grow and care deeply about (why I am such a big fan of him). And he does it again in this series. I LOVE THE CHARACTER OF APOLLO SO MUCH. <3 I am just so invested in all of these rad; beautiful characters in this messy; incredible world that Riordan has created. ALL OF THE MEMORIES AND FEELS. (For those who have not read the Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus series; reading these books will give you major spoilers. You must go read them. Now.)
I think the older I get; the more I grow to appreciate how radical a project that Riordan has undertaken--to write stories where people of color; womxn; LGBTQ+; and other marginalized peoples are normalized and celebrated. That everyone can be a fantastic demigod; hero; or even a god. And along the way; Rick Riordan teaches me so much about mythology without me ever even realizing it.
As Roxane Gay puts it; ""we deserve to be entertained even as the world burns. There is enough room in our collective imagination to care about the fate of the world and"" the fate of Apollo and the whole motley crew. And care we do.

Calypso edged toward the griffins. I followed behind herâ€”not because I was scared to lead; mind you. Everyone knows that when advancing into danger; the soprano goes first.

It has been months since I've read a really entertaining book and I've forgotten just how easy Riordan can make me laugh. This book certainly did not fall short of my expectations! I've been a fan of Riordan since The Lightning Thief days and I found this to be oddly nostalgic (not that the other books weren't but...you know) and satisfyingly awesome. Better than the first book in this series too. Now I just realized how badly I miss Riordan's Greek-Roman world.

RESEÃ‘A DE RELECTURA!
Olvida todo lo que dije sobre TDP la primera vez que lo leÃ­. Es una maravilla.
Dejo el review original porque me gusta a pesar de que ya no comparto estos sentimientos con el yo del 2017.
RATING ORIGINAL: 3 estrellas
RESEÃ‘A ORIGINAL!
""As long as Gods shall live; so long shall I love you""
Voy a manejar porcentajes en este review porque me siento matemÃ¡tico af.
Ok; para empezar; debo decir que este libro no me gustÃ³. No. Lo siento. Pero en un 75% del libro no pASÃ“ NADA! Nada.
De verdad que estoy decepcionada del resultado. La espera y relectura de The Hidden Oracle (al que sÃ­ le di las 5 estrellas porque es perfecto) me subieron muchÃ­simo mÃ¡s las expectativas de The Dark Prophecy; y aquÃ­ estamos: yo; dÃ¡ndole 2/3 estrellas a otra novela y ustedes leyendo mis reseÃas hater de libros que en teorÃ­a debÃ­ amar.
Ahora sÃ­ comenzarÃ©.
""You don't have to be a god. Just do your best to your friends""
Apollo: Honestamente; Apollo ya me cansÃ³. Lo amo y siento una gratitud inmensa a Ã©l por ser mi godly daddy pero; ya me cansÃ©. Este fue Ã©l durante el libro: 25% renegando de su condiciÃ³n mortal y queriendo ser un dios de nuevo porque ser humano apesta; 25% llorando por sus amores perdidos; 50% vomitando. Ese es Ã©l. Aunque debo decir que esas cosas lo hacen un personaje real y creÃ­ble; pero; hasta ahÃ­. Creo que cinco libros es mucho. No sÃ©; Ãºltimamente nada me sorprende.
Otra cosa; yo AMO A LOS LGBT+! Los amo. Pero ya; Rick; un 80% de la poblaciÃ³n en sus libros es comunidad lgbt+; ya casi no quedan heterosexuales en el Riorduniverso o como se llama. En TDP; estÃ¡n Apollo; mas gay que la vaina; (view spoiler).
""He jokes more when he's nervous. He also jokes worse when he's nervous""
(view spoiler)
""I cannot give up; Apollo/Meg needs me""
Meg: Amo a Meg pero aquÃ­ no tanto. No sÃ©; perdiÃ³ su esencia. La amo y espero que tenga un hermoso destino como Persephone o algo; no sÃ©; ya no sÃ© ni quÃ© esperar de Rick. Nada. Nada de nada.
(view spoiler)
De todas formas la amo y amo sus maneras de ser y pensar. Eso de usar chia y el miedo a las serpientes me encanta <3
""We only fail when we stop trying""
El plot: No me gustÃ³ el plot; ni el villano; ni nada de eso. Commodus prometÃ­a pero despuÃ©s si lo que querÃ­a era dominar una ciudad entera; me pareciÃ³ que le faltÃ³ maldad. No sÃ©; Ã©l no me gustÃ³. Me gustÃ³ el arco de transformaciÃ³n de Lityerses; me gustÃ³ mucho. De verdad me hizo pensar sobre el Ãºltimo encuentro que tuve con Lit en The Lost Hero y ha cambiado y crecido mucho. Lo amo.
De resto; nada rescatable; solo Agamethus que me encanta por ser un fantasma sin cabeza y que usa una Magic 8 Ball para predecir el futuro.
(view spoiler)
""The longer you live; the weirder the world gets""
Pero en fin; fue una buena lectura que pude terminar mÃ¡s rÃ¡pido pero estoy buen estÃºpido y tengo que ir a clases. VolverÃ© a verte; papÃ¡; en un par de meses. Gracias por todo; Apollo y Rick por salvarme en los dÃ­as de escuela pensando en avestruces con cascos.
REREAD REVIEW!
Forget everything i said about TDP the first time i read it. It's a masterpiece.
I don't delete my original review because i liked it even though i don't share this 2017-me-thoughts anymore.
ORIGINAL RATING: 3 stars
ORIGINAL REVIEW!
""As long as Gods shall live; so long shall I love you""
I'm going to handle percentages in this review because I feel mathematician af.
Ok; for start with; I must say I didn't like this book. I'm not sorry. But in 75% of the book NOTHING happened! Nothing happened.
I'm really disappointed in the result. The waiting and rereading of The Hidden Oracle (which I gave the 5 stars because it's perfect) I got much higher expectations of The Dark Prophecy; and here we are: I; giving 2/3 stars to another novel and you reading my hater reviews of books that in theory I should have loved.
Now I'll begin.
""You don't have to be a god. Just do your best to your friends""
Apollo: Honestly; Apollo already tired me. I love him and I feel immense gratitude to him for being my godly daddy but; I'm tired. This was him during the book: 25% denying his mortal condition and wanting to be a god again because being human sucks; 25% crying for his lost loves; 50% vomiting. That's him. Although I must say that these things make a real and credible character; but; enough. I think five books is a lot. I don't know; lately nothing surprises me.
Another thing; I LOVE LGBT+! I love them. But now; Rick; 80% of the population in his books is lgbt + community; and there are almost no heterosexuals in the Riorduniverse or whatever it's called. In TDP; there's Apollo; the gayest gay in gayland; (view spoiler).
""He jokes more when he's nervous. He also jokes worse when he's nervous""
(view spoiler)
""I can not give up; Apollo/Meg needs me""
Meg: I love Meg but now not that much. I don't know; she lost her essence. I love her and I hope she has a beautiful destiny like Persephone or something; I don't know; I don't even know what to expect from Rick. Nothing. Nothing at all.
(view spoiler)
Anyway; I love her and I love her ways of being and thinking.
""We only fail when we stop trying""
The plot: I didn't like the plot; nor the villain; nor any of that. Commodus promised; but then if only he wanted to dominate an entire city; it seemed to him that he need to be more evil. I don't know; I didn't liked him. I liked the transformation arc of Lityerses; I liked it a lot. It really made me think about the last encounter I had with Lit in The Lost Hero and he has changed and grown a lot. I love him.
But; nothing salvageable in the rest; only Agamethus that I love him for being a headless ghost that uses a Magic 8 Ball to predict the future.
(view spoiler)
""The longer you live; the weirder the world gets""
But anyway; it was a good read that I could finish faster but I'm really stupid and I have to go to classes. I'll see you again; Dad; in a couple of months. Thanks for everything; Apollo and Rick for saving me on school days thinking about ostriches with helmets. (less)",448,NEXTBOOK

Riordan showcases once again his best skills: an irresistibly engaging narrator; funny and snarky side characters; embarrassing and dangerous scenarios; and an abundance of humor. Infused with allusion to classical mythology and other historical events; the plot is fast-paced and follows Apollo and his friends through a series of tests and other obstacles: he encounters two admirable former Hunters; a certain glass-eyed toughie and plenty of demigods. Apollo's mis-adventures are engrossing: it isn't all fun and games; in fact Riordan manages to incorporate rather sensitive issues without ever interrupting the story's upbeat momentum.

The Dark Prophecy is the second book in the Trials of Apollo; a series focusing on the god Apollo who has been cast down to Earth as a mortal and forced to complete a quest to save everyone. I have a review up for the first book; the one before this review on my blog. I will also warn that there may be a few minor spoilers for book one; but if youâ€™re not too bothered by that then read ahead; friends!
The Dark Prophecy may be my least favourite of Rick Riordanâ€™s books ever. It was just not enjoyable for me. I felt the storyline just fell flat. There wasnâ€™t as much going on and at times it felt that nothing was furthering this story. It was annoying; honestly; and made for a relatively boring plot line. I mean; there were some interesting points but at some points; I felt that there were too many storylines happening within this particular one.
The second book in the Trials of Apollo picks up soon after the first book. We have Leo; Calypso and Apollo ride off on Festus; a mechanical dragon that Leo helped in The Heroesâ€™ of Olympus. Apollo must defeat the next emperor in order to reclaim his oracle. Honestly; I donâ€™t have much of an idea of what really went down in this book. I was pretty confused and Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s because I read the book fast or simply because it wasnâ€™t explained well. I feel that Rick Riordan really used his name to push this crappy book through.
L I K E S
âœ— FAST STORYLINE
I realize I did just complain about this but the storyline was fast. It was action filled and I think thatâ€™s what led to a lot of my confusion throughout the book. I typically love when a lot happens in a book but I just wish that this one had slowed down a little. Maybe itâ€™s because Iâ€™m older but I just feel like these characters deserve a nice nap. I also got lost in the Greek/Roman mythology and kept jumbling them.
Reading back I realized that this should be in dislikes but I did enjoy the storyline.
âœ— GOOD CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
Every character but our lead had some great character development. Theyâ€™re all growing and realizing things (wow; Kylie Jenner is up in here). A lot of characters come to a standstill in Rick Riordanâ€™s second books; in my opinion; but I feel like the cast; overall; was being pushed forward which made for an obviously more enjoyable story.
âœ— A F/F COUPLE
Why did one of my favourite couples have to be in the worst books? I have a theory that f/f couples are literally the best to read about. They always make me giddy and the couple in The Dark Prophecy was no different. Emmie and Josephine are ex-Hunters of Artemis who fell in love with each other and left. It is bittersweet. They take care of the Waystation now; where Hunters drop in every now and again and help care for them. I loved it. Their added storyline was one that made me really happy to read; but also really sad.
Iâ€™m still stoked that there was an f/f couple. If only Rick Riordan would put one at the centre of his books. There arenâ€™t enough in fiction; especially YA and middle grade.
D I S L I K E S
âœ— FELT LIKE ALL THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THAT APOLLO HAD THE LAST BOOK DISAPPEARED
This has to be my biggest complaint. Obviously; weâ€™ve already read one book from Apolloâ€™s perspective; but it felt that everything he had done in the past book was gone. It had literally disappeared and he no longer cared again. It just felt like we were starting from scratch. At times his voice throughout the novel grated on me as well. I read all three books very close together and this was the only one that did that to me.
Apollo is obviously going to be a jerk and will not change 100% by the end of this series; Iâ€™m just still so annoyed because he had gained some sense of caring throughout The Hidden Oracle and The Dark Prophecy had it gone.
I did not read a whole book to have my time wasted in a second; no way.
âœ— AT TIMES IT FEELS LIKE THE CHARACTERS FROM OTHER BOOKS TAKE OVER THE STORY
I can see what Rick Riordan is trying to do; heâ€™s trying to show fans of his other series the happy endings of the previous characters they wrote. However; it just felt weak at times. Maybe itâ€™s because I donâ€™t care about either Leo or Calypso but it felt that at times their bickering and post-war romance took over. I really didnâ€™t care. Obviously; the previous book had included Percy Jackson; which I had no problems but; it just felt different here.
It really just felt like Rick Riordan was trying too hard; that he had no idea what he was doing throughout this book.
Overall; The Dark Prophecy isnâ€™t a bad book despite all my complaining. I did enjoy it but after reading every other of Rick Riordanâ€™s books it just didnâ€™t live up to the standards I had for this. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the voice of Apollo completely or simply the fact that Iâ€™m a picky bitch. Who knows; hopefully; the third book is better or I may just have to give up on this series.

I thought this book was quietly brutal. And quietly beautiful; as well.
If you've come here looking for magical realism; I would advise against it. Exit West contains only the barest of fantastical elements - essentially; metaphorical doors or portals that symbolize the migrant experience. This is not explored in any depth and serves only to propel the characters from their unnamed homeland to Greece; then London; then America.
Exit West is really about the relationship between the young couple; Saeed and Nadia; and how their experiences as migrants in foreign countries affects who they are and what they need. Held together by a shared past; they try to cling to one another; even as they grow into very different people. It's subtle and exquisitely bittersweet.
The book starts in a country in the middle of political turmoil. The country is not named; but that is not really the point; for it could be any country in the middle of crisis. Any country that forces its people to try to seek out a better life elsewhere. When Saeed's mother is killed and the threat of violence becomes too much; Saeed and Nadia talk to a man who promises to get them out.
They are both irreparably changed by the move to new places that are at once both comforting and unwelcoming. I think the power of this book lies in the lack of manipulation and sentimentality. In many ways; it's just a love story between two vibrant; pot-smoking young people who are affected by forces beyond their control.
It is these kind of quietly moving stories that affect me most of all. Authors who try to create dramatic; tear-inducing scenes never move me emotionally; but those who craft scenes of gentle truth can totally rip my heart out. And that's exactly what happened here.

I just cannot continue. Exit West is one of the most bitterly disappointing and downright awful novels I have read in a long while.
The novel begins with Nadia and Saeed; a couple living in an unnamed Middle-Eastern city. This setting and story is what we come to expect from Hamid; who also wrote the flawed but admirable The Reluctant Fundamentalist. The city is crumbling around Nadia and Saeed; blackouts are frequent; the water supply is often cut and drones hover overhead at all times. But yet; despite these enormous setbacks and struggles; they live on. If the novel were just the couple and their fight to live in their city; then what a wonderful book it would have been. I truthfully absolutely loved these initial scenes. They are a fascinating study of a couple in wartime. But then Hamid fucks everything up.
Hamid; possessed by his own ego and the spirit of Salman Rushdie; decides that this perfectly serviceable novel needs something extra. A little bit of magic needed to be injected into the story. Literally. For some unknown reason; Hamid has these magical doors pop up all around the world. Doorways that lead you to anywhere in the world. You step into a door in the Middle East and suddenly you are on Mykonos. This concept sounded familiar to me; but I couldn't pinpoint it exactly. So I read on.
It is inevitable that our couple is shown to one of these doors and are whisked away from their city and their lives. The second they step foot into the magical door is when the novel goes from fairly good to absolute shit. Why did Hamid add this ridiculous conceit to this novel? Why would he sabotage himself like this? I tried to ignore all door nonsense; but then it happened again. Hamid completely abandoned his great story of a couple in wartime to focus on his stupid doors. And then it hit me. I knew where I had seen this concept before.
It's Monsters Inc.
This book is fucking Monsters Inc.
The moment I realised this I just could not continue. I had to end it. And thus we are here. I'd like to say that I'm not angry; I'm just disappointed but I am angry and disappointed. Hamid's ridiculous urge to write magical realism is possibly one of the most ill-fated attempts at cross-genre literature ever. It could have been so great if his editor had just said; hey Mohsin; you have a great novel here but all this door shit has to go. It's a shame. Think of what we could have had. (less)",453,NEXTBOOK

""In a city swollen by refugees but still mostly at peace; or at least not yet openly at war; a young man met a young woman in a classroom and did not speak to her.""
So begins Mohsin Hamid's extraordinary new novel; Exit West . At once both sharply current and dreamily magical; this book is social commentary; fantasy; and an emotion-laded look at how we crave connection even in the most chaotic; the bleakest of times.
While reading this book; all I could think of was:
When Saeed and Nadia first meet in a night class; they both are intrigued with each other; but neither acts on it. In an unnamed country beset by impending civil war; pursuing a romantic relationship isn't high on either one's priority list. Nadia is fiercely independent; living alone; and not afraid of embracing her sensuality; while Saeed is more contemplative; quiet; and less sure of himself.
They first pursue a friendship; and then both begin to realize just how much they come to rely on each other; intellectually; emotionally; and socially. When the warring factions begin exerting their power over the country; enforcing curfews; restricting electricity; cutting phone signals and internet coverage; each worries about the other's safety; and their feelings for each other grow; if not quite into love for both; at least something stronger than friendship.
""Dramatic circumstances; such as those in which they and other new lovers in the city now found themselves; have a habit of creating dramatic emotions; and furthermore the curfew served to conjure up an effect similar to that of a long-distance relationship; and long-distance relationships are well known for their potential to heighten passion; at least for a while; just as fasting is well known to heighten one's appreciation for food.""
As full-on violence and terror ebb and flow; and tragedy strikes; the two become even closer. They despair over their future; whether they will survive the war; and where it will leave them. More and more; they hear rumors of doors; doors which somehow can help people like them escape far away from the violenceÂ—although not without risk; and not without great cost. At first; the thought of leaving seems cowardly and wrong; but the more the violence escalates; they realize they have no choice. After much trepidation; they find a door and see where it leads.
At this point; Exit West 's plot becomes a little dreamier; but still equally present and powerful; as it not only examines the effects strife; stress; and constant fear and suspicion have on a relationship; but it's also a pointed look at the refugee experience; and how people in the same situation can treat each other.
This book worked for me on so many levels. At a time in our world where some wish to label all immigrants in a negative way; this is a stark reminder of why so many flee their countries; and how their humanity is often lost in the process. But beyond the social and philosophical commentary; this book is; at its heart; a story of relationships; of love; of loss; and the sacrifices we make for those we love.
""...he understood; at some level; that to love is to enter into the inevitability of one day not being able to protect what is most valuable to you.""
Hamid is an extraordinary writer. For as many quotes as I pulled from the book for this review; I found hundreds more. His prose is dazzling; his imagery at once sublime and gritty; and the emotions he generates from this story are genuine; not manipulated. This is a book that has touched me; one which has made me think and feel; one which I will remember and linger over.
For some; the fantastical elements of the plot may not work; but if you allow yourself to become fully immersed in the entire experience; hopefully you will savor it as I have. This is simply fantastic.

The synopsis makes it sound like we're going to have two lovers who are in a city that is becoming a war zone and then discover magical doors that lead them far away and it's hard but they have each other. That's definitely what happens... but it's also really not what happens. I'd say that's the first third of this book. If I were to give a synopsis it would be: Two people meet and because their city becomes a war zone they find themselves as refugees that aren't sure about their premature dependancy on each other. Do you see how that's the same but also really different?
Did I think this book was great? Yes. Mohsin Hamid is a great writer who had a great idea and really knows how to deliver subtle but powerful moments. His story of these refugees; and refugees from all over the world; actually exposed me to a new way of thinking. I think reading this book made me a better person. You know how people often say that they read books because they want to learn about new perspectives? This is it. This will teach you to empathize; to consider others more complexly.
And so I feel cheated in a way. Had I actually known that I was going to be reading about two people suffering immensely as they find themselves stranded around the world in a new relationship that they're not sure about rather than thinking I was reading about two lovers who are on a hard but whimsical tale I wouldn't have kept thinking ""wait; this isn't what I thought... huh?!"" while reading it.
That's the power of marketing. When I look at this book on my shelf now I'm just a little confused. I feel like I need to read it again with my expectations shifted. (less)",455,NEXTBOOK

We need more books like this; or no; maybe that's wrong; what we need are more readers of books like this. The country it takes place is unnamed; but one part makes it sound as if it is in Asia somewhere. A country under siege by opposing parties; a country at war with itself; a dangerous place; how so many in this world live in constant danger; constant war.
Saeed and Nadia meet; forge a relationship; when their country erupts in violence; it becomes unlivable. They seek ways to leave; hire a coyote who is able to find doors; some literal but in this case fantastical; pay him; try to convince Saeed's father to come with; the only viable parent between the two; but he refuses; His dead wife is buried here; and this is his home. Eventually they will step through more doors; after each location losing a bit more of themselves. Trying to find a place where they feel they can exist. Refugees among many; they are not wanted; tarred and judged by those among them who are making trouble. All painted with the same brush. From a deserted mansion; to a tent city to the coast of California; they will travel; two among many; all seeking the same thing; continent to continent; all fleeing their own countries.
Although the description describes this as a bittersweet love story; it is not written emotionally; rather narrated by a omnipresent presence; in a rather matter of fact way. I liked this and didn't; the feelings and things described often seemed at a distance. The situation though is universal; important and timely and so it could be said that telling the story this way lets the reader form his or her own opinions. The magical realism; is used well; fleetingly and adds to the the main message of the story; the refugees seeming to come from everywhere; so many war torn countries.
The ending; I loved; as Goldilocks said; ""This one is just right.""

What started out to be a gorgeously haunting look at life in a Middle East city at the brink of civil war turned ponderous and perplexing by the end of Mohsin Hamid's slim novel Exit West.
In an unnamed city in an unnamed Middle Eastern country (not unlike the similarly themed Guapa by Saleem Haddad); two young professionals (Saeed; a quiet; pious man who lives with his parents and works for an advertising firm specializing in billboards and bus placards; and Nadia; an enigmatic ""black-robe"" wearing; motorcycle riding; lone wolf of a woman who works at an insurance agency) cross paths while taking a class at a college. It's not immediately clear what the attraction is between the two (perhaps just the uncertainty of warring militants wreaking havoc on their respective neighborhoods and the government's iron-fisted response resulting in massive bloodshed and escalating body counts from combatants and civilians alike) but the two uneasily bond; navigating the imposed curfews; dodging the outbreaks of terroristic violence to provide companionship for each other. As the violence escalates; massive blackouts; food and water shortages ensue; and Saeed and Nadia are forced to stay away from their jobs and hole up in their apartments; caught in the crossfire between the insurgent militants and the government's bombing raids. As life in the city becomes increasingly untenable; they decide to flee for their lives.
And that's when the bottom falls out for me; when the hyperrealism of the couple's plight; so vividly and convincingly displayed by Hamid in the first half of the novel; takes a bizarre CS Lewis-ian turn toward unreality (in a way; reminiscent of Cora's flight north from the slave hunter in The Underground Railroad); using scattered; secret doors as portals for Saeed's and Nadia's means for escape.
I liked Hamid's idea; but his choice (in contrast to the extremely well-written set-up) just left me lost in the lurch. From that point (of taking a turn toward speculative fiction) onward; everything felt hastily written and not especially thought out well. Compounding matters is the very skimpy length (an additional 75 pages or so more could have afforded a much better explanation for those doors; and what happens beyond them). Things that I enjoyed about Hamid's writing style in the first half really started annoying me the more I became frustrated (the two biggest problems: the run-on; grammatically unsound sentences; and the dearth of dialogue between characters.)
I'm glad I read this novel; as its subject matter is timely and salient; and allowed me to finally be acquainted with Mr. Hamid's work; but ultimately; Exit West didn't quite work for me. More patient readers than I am might be able to abide his flights of fancy here; but I was left cold by this strange take on the refugee experience. (less)",457,NEXTBOOK

Yeah; my memory is not that good. It took me a while to write a review due to a combination of hectic days at work and a new kitty at home (our first one).
Waiting so long to review also had its perks as I decided to change my rating from 4 to 3. I did not remain with the impression that it was a book that I would warmly recommend. Also; I was lucky to read the much better Home Fire; another book by A Pakistani writer nominated for the Booker prize.
The book has as center theme the plight of being a refugee and I believe the relevance of the subject in todayâ€™s world is what makes the short novel so successful. Mohsin tells the story of two young people from an unknown Muslim state; Nadia and Saeed; who fell in love and decide to flee from the country plagued by war. In Exit West; the refugee crisis takes Apocalyptic proportions due to the use of a fantasy device. Refugees use doors to travel to safer countries; doors that randomly transform into passages to another place. Due to this gimmick there are no more painful and perilous voyages in the cold waters of the Mediterranean or on land which; in my opinion; is a loss. I would have liked to read about the trip part in the refugeeâ€™s life. I might have added drama and warmth to the character's story line.
I did not like the characters too much and I could not warm up to them and their plight. I did enjoy how the book was written and constructed but the somewhat forced smartness made me detached to the story. I donâ€™t know if I am making too much sense but this is how I felt.

I donâ€™t say such things liberally; it really did have a certain power due to it being so politically conscious; though somehow it failed to deliver what it could have done.
Let us rewind a little. Exit West begins in an undisclosed east; in a city at war. The corrupt government is subsequently toppled and the new regime isnâ€™t exactly any better. The ordinary citizens; those with no particular political ties; are forced to do whatever they are told by whoever happens to be in power. Post-revolutionaries donâ€™t exactly make life any better.
Enter Nadia and Saeed. They fall in love in the chaos that is approaching. The real world matters are pushed aside as they deal with the only real matter in their lives. They ignore the gunfire and the explosions and simply live for each other. Everything else is inconsequential until their lives become drastically threatened. Their freedom is a risk and as such they long for escape; they wish to leave the east and; as the title suggests; exit west. They leave much behind them in their bid for freedom though they know that; ultimately; it is worth it because they have each other. And hereâ€™s where the novel goes shooting down the toilet at light speed.
The only thing that would save it for me is a drastic re-writing of the last one hundred pages. As soon as the lovers exited west; all power the story had was wasted because of the mundane nature of what they then faced. I needed drama and I needed angry people and contentious political comment. Instead I got nothing. And this is where the novelâ€™s potential was missed. What began as a political allegory ended as a petty domestic dispute. It would have been far more effective if when Nadia and Saeed finally exited west; they were met with all the issues surrounding immigration and refugees. I wanted to see hostility and fear in the eyes of the westerners; I wanted to Moshin Hamid tackle one of the most politically sensitive issues of our age. Had he written such a thing; from the perspective of the refugee; I think it would have been an exceedingly timely piece of writing.
It fell apart. Nadia and Saeed focus on matters of survival as the narrative goes absolutely nowhere. They shift from place to place as no progress is made within the writing other than the slow degrading of their relationship. For me; it all felt like one terribly large wasted opportunity. The author could have done so much more here.
And to quote the author to illustrate my point:
â€œWhen we migrate; we murder from our lives those we leave behind.â€
When the characters migrated; Hamid murdered the potential of this novel leaving it behind in the dust. It was such a bitter disappointment because this novel could have been exceptional: it so nearly was. (less)",460,NEXTBOOK

Nadia is living alone - as a young single female. When she leaves her flat; she wears a flowing black robe over her jeans and sweater which completely covers every inch of her body. This is her choice.
Why would a modern thinking young woman - who rides a motorbike - who attends business classes - who chooses to live alone -
who buys her own pot and psychedelic mushrooms for her own recreational pleasures-'also' choose to 'cover up' her body -during times when other young people her age are not?
Nadia is not religious- and doesn't pray. 'Seems' Nadia black robe doesn't fit everything else about her.
It is far from peaceful times. Beneath the surface of things....Militants are creating turmoil. Tensions grow - violence grows - an ugly - gut wrenching scene takes place in a bank -intimately & globally....I couldn't stop thinking about this scene --AS MUCH AS I WANTED TO. The scene was so irrational to me. It felt like Nadia's whole world shifted in that moment. And on the bigger scale -- I felt the whole world really 'did' shift....in a matter of seconds!!
Saeed and and Nadia each have very different types of personalities. As enticing and seductive as it was to bask in their togetherness; they actually had a very complicated relationship during very complicated times. There relationship continues to change as their circumstances do; too.
Leaving their 'no name' city-of-violence and injustice was as easy as going down the rabbit hole.....or in ""Exit West""; Saeed and Nadia simply needed to walk through the ""mysterious doors"".
The 'doors' are a quick transitions to journey 'west'.
I liked the way the author told this story. Rather than focus on the struggles of escaping - leaving a country at war....( such as I've read in Holocaust stories); we are quickly able to step into the new country with our leading characters.
What will Saeed and Nadia find on the other side of loss?
What sits for all migrants when uprooted? displaced?
And.....BEFORE departing from home - from family - before the hugs......
How does this feel?
""Saeed's Father then summoned Nadia into his room and spoke to her without Saeed and said that he was entrusting her with his son's life; and she; whom he called daughter; must; like a daughter; not fail him; whom she called father; and she must see Saeed through to safety; and he hoped she would one day marry his son and be called mother by his grandchildren; but this was at to them to decide; and all he asked was that she remain by Saeed's side until Saeed was out of danger; and he asked her to promise this to him; and she said she would promise only is Saeed's father came with them; and he said again that he could not; but that they must go; he said it softly; like a prayer; and she sat there with him in silence and the minutes passed; and in the end she promised; and it was an easy promise to make because she had at the time no thoughts of leaving Saeed; but it also a difficult one because in making it she felt she was abandoning the old man; and even if he did not have his siblings and his cousins; and might now go live with them or have them come live with him; they could not protect him as Saeed and Nadia could; and so by making the promise he demanded she make she was in a sense killing him; that is the way of things; for when we migrate; we murder from our lives those we leave behind"".
SAD! ........ but hopeful.... anticipating brighter days!!!

Nadia; the heroine; covers herself in black veils but as a defence against predatory or bigoted males rather than as an expression of religious or cultural conviction. Living spaces in this novel are depicted as temporary; transient; replacable. Even national identity is largely a series of acquisitions and adaptations; rather than some ineradicable essence of our being. National identity when articulated in language is so often just bigotry. I remember during Brexit the Brits who spouted off about national identity were individuals who made me feel ashamed of my country. If thatâ€™s what being British is you can lump it. What even is national identity? To my mind about 80% of it is simply speaking the language of the country you live in; the simple ability to communicate â€“ which is why tourism might easily be seen as a more lethal contributor to cultural homogeneity than immigration: ask any Venetian. Iâ€™ve lived half of my life in Italy; Italians tell me Iâ€™m more Italian than British. But this isnâ€™t true. I havenâ€™t had to change much about myself to live in Italy. I go to a bar for breakfast; I gesture more with my hands than I did in England. But itâ€™s wholly irrelevant that Iâ€™m not catholic for example. To fit in Iâ€™ve barely had to change anything about myself. So if there is such a thing as national identity and itâ€™s linked to cultural identity â€“ both essentially dubious notions in my view otherwise why would I find myself relating much more to a Somalian jewellery designer than the neighbours of my parents? â€“ you could say the true enemy is not the immigrant but the tourist; who rarely learns the language of the visited country. Hamid is saying we're all; in the context of history; migrants; just as we're all tourists. Thereâ€™s a distinction between Hamidâ€™s two central characters; Nadia and Saeed: she is open to change; he; more the tourist in mindset; far less so. The magical device Hamid uses in this novel might on the one hand been seen as the digital ease with which we can now move about the planet but can also be seen as a metaphor for the travel agency in all its modern myriad forms; including people smuggling. Thereâ€™s a nice little aside from a Native American in California towards the end of this book which brings home how absurd many of our concepts of national identity are.
Itâ€™s probably invalid to criticise an author for not doing something he had no intention of doing but Iâ€™m going to do it anyway. Hamid is so caught up with presenting a big picture that he often seems to neglect his characters. Sometimes theyâ€™re unable to articulate his ideas so he introduces a fleeting character of convenience who can. It was like the ideas of this book left his two central characters behind. At times it can seem more like some kind of brilliantly imagined essay than a novel. Perhaps thatâ€™s not necessarily a bad thing. Iâ€™m all for extending the boundaries of what a novel can achieve. But his virtual indifference to developing character began to make this novel seem like the literary equivalent of an air-conditioned environment for me. There was no weather. There was one particular moment when I most strongly felt this. The two refugees are in London and face racism and xenophobic nationalism in the form of a rioting crowd. The entire scene is depicted as if through a wide angle lens. Itâ€™s impersonal in nature. I couldnâ€™t help feeling it would have been much more powerful and emotionally engaging had the author shown these two refugees being racially insulted close up by a small group of individuals and wondering why he didnâ€™t do this. Racism at its most emotionally disturbing for me is when I see footage of one or more individuals insult another individual face to face. When the hate and hurt caused are of a highly personal nature. Thatâ€™s when empathy for the victim is at its most powerful. And as a result of the impersonal nature of the hostility it seemed to have little effect on the character of the characters. They just drifted off to the next location with barely a metaphorical scratch. As the novel progressed the camera angle got wider and wider until I could barely make them out anymore. The ideas utterly dwarfed them. It felt more and more like this novel was written as a warning and the central thesis felt like a corset the characters were forced to wear which prevented them from developing as characters. They ended up little more than shadow shapes flitting over the globe â€“ on the one hand brilliantly indicative of a universal modern truth but on the other frustrating from the point of view of my need to relate to the characters I read about.
Exit West is a tough one to star rate. Probably the most straightforward way to rate a novel is simply by how much you enjoyed reading it. If someone hated reading The Waves or War and Peace then why shouldnâ€™t she give it one star irrespective of how much literary merit it might have? But sometimes weâ€™re able to admire what we feel little love for; like the eloquence of a politician all of whose convictions we disagree with. Not that I disagreed with Hamidâ€™s convictions but I canâ€™t really say I loved this novel as a novel; though it was hugely thought provoking and extremely relevant to the times we live in.

This strange little novel definitely has the feel of a season of sense8; the Netflix Original production about shifts in consciousness; space; and time. Hamidâ€™s characters; Nadia and Saeed; experience the bending of time and place; as when they leave their own war-torn country on the Asian subcontinent; a â€œpassage both like dying and like being born.â€
Hamidâ€™s female character Nadia; who insists on being draped in a black cloak; or abaya; is more risk-taking and forward-thinking than Saeed. Nadia; not religious; wears the abaya to deflect attention; and it works; usually. Sometimes she does draw the anger or ire of men; when she is riding a powerful motorcycle or working in a store; but she doesn't back down; staring at the men steadily; aware and awake but not showing fear.
Perceptions of the abaya change in the course of the novel. Once a means of conformity and of escaping notice; in the west and in the future the abaya becomes a statement of nonconformity and defiance. Nadia likes this gesture even better.
Saeed; on the other hand; is good; kind; compassionate; nonviolent: he does not enjoy a tangle and avoids rather than confronts. Heâ€™d learned to pray from his father; much as one is taught to think critically or handle difficulty. Praying became â€œa lament; a consolationâ€¦a hopeâ€ that steadied and centered him.
Throughout the novel these alternate approaches to life gently grate on the two young lovers who had not decided to spend their lives together until they found they had no option. The genuine love they feel for one another feels like displacement; since the families of each are lost.
The refugee life; landing on Mykonos and somehow being smuggled to London; is hazy in process; but not in content. The danger; the hunger; the uncertainty; the resistance from light-skinned nativesâ€¦these feel some years in the future; despite our current history; because electricity is becoming scarce; and times are harsh. Time in this novel is intentionally fluid and hard to reckon.
One day when Nadia sees on her phone a woman in a black abaya reading something on her phone; â€œshe wondered how this could be; how she could both read this news and be this news.â€ Time was bending around her: she might be from the past reading about the future or she might be from the future reading about the past. She might be two Nadiasâ€¦going in different directions.
Hamid also dislocates the reader in space; in one paragraph describing Nadia and Saeed in London and in the next describing a family in Mexico; just miles from the Pacific on the U.S. border; facing a paradoxically dry environment so close to water. No explanation is given for this wild shift west; as far west as one can get before entering again the east.
What happens in the novel is that time moves away from us. Hamid imagines our future; folding time and location. Remember Ruth Ozekiâ€™s A Tale for the Time Being in which time is folded? Ozeki makes a statement about physics; love; and life on earth; and I think Hamid might be pointing to this also. His characters love one another; but the stresses of their needs wear them out. They find sometimes that it is just easier to try to slide through the cracks alone; though sometimes one wouldnâ€™t survive alone. Think electrons. Think quantum theory.
The lifetime Hamid describes in this novel feels like it could be now and also a long time in the future: a Muslim country torn apart; population movement via smugglers; a Greek island; Europe. But interspersed we are also getting news from Japan; South America; Northern Africa. Something big has happened. The policies of control at first are harsh and then loosen; so we suspect a big event. Borders are no more and groups of people try to decide the best way to govern; to protect; to provide.
In one of the narrative shifts; Hamid points to a woman of advanced years and Asian descent living in Palo Alto. The woman lives in the same house sheâ€™d lived in since childhood; the house having passed to her from her parents. Sheâ€™d been married more than once; had children; all while living in the house and yet now she felt distant from her neighborhood. Everything had changed around her while she stayed still. She was a migrant; too; Hamid suggests; because time had made her own insular unchanging world anachronistic. ""We are all migrants through time.""
This was a difficult book to understand through listening. I had the Penguin Random House production read by the author (thank you PRH Audio). Hamid read the book as though it were poetry; with stylized stops and breaths and some distance from the material. At times I felt totally involved; understanding it cognitively; but his sudden shifts to different parts of the world seemed intentionally dislocating.
The final quarter of the novel really threw me. I listened to it five or more times and within a few sentences my mind was wandering each time. There must be something in there that sends me off; not computing. I downloaded a print copy (Thank you Riverhead & Edelweiss). This work is a good candidate for Audible's Whispersync option.
This novel breaks new ground for Hamid. You are going to find yourself mulling his meaning as you examine our recent past; live through our near term; and contemplate our future. (less)",463,NEXTBOOK

I ended up wondering if a lot of the praise itâ€™s received has more to do with its subject matter than its quality as a novel.
Its subject matter is the plight of refugees â€“ without question one of the most potentially moving and pertinent stories offered by the world we live in. But this novel was oddly unmoving for the most part; due to the somewhat anaemic and dispassionate nature of its two central characters. Saeed and Nadia both begin the novel as fascinating characters. Weâ€™re not told where they live though we canâ€™t help thinking Syria. Nadia rides a motorbike; has disowned her family; lives alone in her own apartment and yet wears a black gown â€“ as a kind of protective disguise rather than a symbol of any religious belief. You could therefore say sheâ€™s already a long way down the path to being â€œwesternisedâ€. Saeed is more grounded in tradition. Itâ€™s as if Hamid wants to give us two characters who donâ€™t radically differ from us in the West; characters we can easily identify with. But to do this he ends up making them a bit bland. When they fall in love Nadia is willing to have sex; Saeed isnâ€™t. Then the militants arrive.
The most undocumented; harrowing and dangerous part of a refugeeâ€™s life is absent from this novelâ€“ the journey from besieged homeland to the west. We donâ€™t see the escape from the militant strangehold; the boat trip or the detention centre on Europeâ€™s shores â€“ in other words all the parts of the perilous and demeaning experience that are most likely to make a deep and changing impression on an individualâ€™s character. And not only do we not see them we donâ€™t feel the characters have experienced them; so unchanged do they remain. They make the transition from the horrors of a war torn country to â€œsanctuaryâ€ in the West with barely a hair on their head ruffled. Hamid uses a device called magic doors to get his characters from one place to another. (Virginia Woolf once complained about the necessity of getting a character from A to B as a woeful limitation of the novelâ€™s form but Iâ€™m not sure what she had in mind as an alternative was the device Hamid uses.) Is this device clever or is it a failure of imagination? Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™d opt for the latter. The narrative adheres to images weâ€™re familiar with; it excludes the ones weâ€™re not. Because the main problem I had with this novel is that Saeed and Nadia donâ€™t really develop as characters throughout the novel; they never became vivid and living to me; their plight never moved me. They remained strangely neutered. They were too relentlessly rational in a world that was insanely irrational. They were like people experiencing the horrors on social media rather than on their nerves and skin.
London gets a very raw deal in this novel. Itâ€™s depicted as a place where natavists â€“ xenophobic nationalists â€“ are on the warpath in large numbers. Hamidâ€™s idea of London has far more in common with Donald Trumpâ€™s notions about it than any reality I recognise. London voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and the Labour party recently annihilated the Tories in virtually every borough. If thereâ€™s one place in Europe which has a welcoming attitude towards migrants London could hold itself up as a candidate. Perhaps it doesnâ€™t matter very much because this is a novel that gingerly remains one step removed from the real world. But if the city of Saeed and Nadiaâ€™s birth is never mentioned why single London out?
Probably Iâ€™ve concentrated exclusively on what didnâ€™t work for me so I should say that I think Hamid is a very good writer â€“ there are lots of excellent passages. I enjoyed the film of another of his novels. But this left me virtually unmoved which I canâ€™t help seeing as a failure given the unchartered; volatile and heartbreaking potential of its subject matter.

Mohsin Hamid - The Author
We are all migrants through time
Moshin Hamid - Exit West
***********************************************
Literature fulfills many roles in our lives. We read to learn about a certain topic; to develop a deeper sense of empathy; in search of enlightenment or just as a pure source of escapism. In Exit West; author Mohsin Hamid pursues a highly idealistic but worthy goal; namely; to give us a story that regards our planet's geography; its borders; and resources in a different way.
Exit West is a wonder of a novel. Hamid stunning writing flows elegantly and beautifully and; in spite of its obvious political undercurrents; this is not an overtly political story. Instead; the author strives to take a more universal; existential and ultimately hopeful view on the issue of the refugee crisis and how the global community is reacting to it.
There is also a romance here but this is far from a conventional love story. We first encounter Nadia and Saeed in their mid-20s; just as they meet while attending a business workshop. As it tends to happen when people are attracted to each other; they are in many ways; complete opposites. Whereas Saeed is a conformist who still lives with his parents and subscribes to most conventional norms and traditions; Nadia thrives in challenging them. She is non-religious; drives a motorcycle and is sexually adventurous.
The country and city where they live remain nameless; but we learn from the start that this is a place on the brink of political and social upheaval. A civil war between the government and local Islamic militants is all but imminent.
Syrian refugees at a camp in Bulgaria
Still; Hamid emphasizes how; even in the midst of chaos and facing perilous circumstances; people strive to live ordinary lives. And so they work; they study; they pray; they fall in love. Or; as he puts it ""Our eternally impending ending does not put a stop to our transient beginning and middles until the instant when it does."" We humans are nothing if not resilient.
Eventually; the militants succeed in taking control of the city; forcing many; including Saeed and Nadia; to flee the country. It is here that Hamid inserts a rather unconventional literary device: mysterious â€œdoorsâ€; which can be used as portals to travel from country to country; begin to appear everywhere; effectively allowing people to become instant immigrants.
When I first heard the author describing these ""magical"" doors; the idea sounded so farfetched that I wondered if it might get in the way of the story. Fortunately; my concerns were misplaced as Hamid threads this concept so flawlessly into the narrative that shortly you just absorb it. This is not I think; by accident but by design; the physics and mechanical details of how these doors are supposed to work is not what he wants the reader to focus on.
Saeed and Nadia's decision to leave underscores; once again; their contrasting personalities; Saeed dreads leaving his family behind and is weary of what lies ahead. Nadia on the other hand; is driven by what she might find behind those doors and the opportunities that might be awaiting them on the other side.
The novel's first chapters are devoted to the ""leaving"" part of the immigrant experience. Hamid explores the agonizing process people go through once they decide to leave their country of origin as well as the many concerns they have to live with: Will I survive the journey? Will I ever see my country and family again? How soon will I adapt to this new place? Will I feel welcomed?
Syrian refugees arrive on Lesbos; Greece
The next part of Exit West which covers the ""arrival"" part of the journey; follows Nadia and Saeed's life as refugees. Their travels will take them initially to the Greek Island of Mykonos; later on to London; and finally to Marin County; California. As time passes; the young couple remains protective of each other but they gradually fall out of love. By the end what has kept them together is mostly a sense of loyalty and a fear of losing their only connection to the past.
Exit West has been marketed under the ""Magical Realism"" genre. For readers that might not find this description particularly enticing; I would say that this label applies only in the narrowest sense. Hamid's half-hearted embrace of some fantastical elements seems mostly design to underscore the parts of the narrative he wishes to keep in the forefront. To wit; the long-term patterns of human migration throughout history; the physical and emotional plight refugees endured every day and; for good or bad; the ubiquitous presence of technology in their lives.
Unlike the characters in this work of fiction; real life refugees don't have access to magic doors to escape their predicament. Exit West offers a sensible; often nuanced interpretation of what it means to be displaced; of the distribution of our planet's limited resources and; in these times of Brexit and Trump; ask us to consider; what if we were to try another approach to the current refugee crisis?
Rarely do I feel compelled to re-read a novel the moment after I finish it; but that was my exact reaction to this poignant story. A highly recommended read. (less)",465,NEXTBOOK

The story here is a close allegory of the contemporary migrant experience; and the clever use of a surrealist device (I won't spoil it) and the close 3rd realism with which the two leads are drawn makes a deep; lasting impact.
The surreal/real mix is echoed in Hamid's clever mingling of classicism and the contemporary - EXIT WEST is a firm rebuke to those who argue that novels can't incorporate modern technology without feeling overly experimental. Phones and the internet replace letters and nostalgia; and in that replacement they show that it's possible to achieve strong feelings through our devices. The violence is a contradiction too; it's both brutal and largely occurs passively; off-screen; a rumor with glimpses of horror at the periphery (a soccer game; a bloody ceiling).
Best of all; this is a love story; and a good one. You find yourself caring for both Nadia and Saeed; veering between indignation for one and the other; with the great callbacks and setups that make real-life relationships feel plotted. The best; most difficult love stories necessitate rooting for the individuals even more than the coupling; and Hamid pulls it off.
I did feel the book could be a touch longer; and in its desire to make itself universal; it perhaps suffers a touch from its non-specifics. This is not a criticism; exactly; but it's a clear choice by Hamid to name and map the Western world while consigning Nadia and Saeed to Anytown; and I sometimes felt the frustration of that vagueness. On the other hand; to leave leaders and politics totally out of it and only show the effect of their decisions felt exactly right. And we don't miss the scene lesser writers might have given us in which a scientist leans back in his chair and gives a hazily realistic explanation for the surreality. We are happy not to have it.
A late twist with Nadia; on the other hand (you'll know the one); felt a bit out of nowhere and could have used one more beat of set-up to make it feel earned. I'm not complaining about the plot-point; exactly; but the novel's sparseness makes certain second-half maneuvers feel schematic in comparison to the rich world of the beginning.
I won't spoil the ending; but it works too. Almost all of this does. I sense that; as so often happens; an ocean of political hype might soon drown out the literary achievement here. Don't fall for it.

Though a thin slip of a novel; Exit West packs a powerful punch cloaked subtly in a quiet but dynamic tale of migration; told in exquisite yet plain language that is thought provoking and soothing and enraging and just plain beautiful. Nadia and Saeed of a unnamed nation are the focal points; and we follow their journey through young love in a country on the precipice of civil war; to unsteady allies as unwanted refugees in lands reasserting their nativeness and excluding the foreign and alien; to adults grappling with their changing selves and connections to each other and their home while building a new; uncertain future. But Mohsin Hamid makes this story so universal; drawing in smaller and larger patterns of human migration; of love and loss; and the ephemeral nature of humanity that makes one life and all life so precious and so precarious. I would give this 4.5 stars; rounded up to 5 stars for the depth of feeling and intelligence and beauty in the writing.
For one moment; we are pottering about our errands as usual and the next we are dying; and our eternally impending ending does not put a stop to our transient beginnings and middles until the instant that it does.
Hamid presents the constant churn of connection versus alienation; of new possibilities versus bittersweet nostalgia; of the cages we build for ourselves that we yearn to transcend versus the freedom we long for but also fear; of the comfort and joy of love versus how that love turns to loss and heartbreak: these all apply to our particular lives; and Nadia and Saeedâ€™s tale for certain; but also to the essence of what it means to be human. We are all migrants through time is the quote most often cited by previous reviewers; and as the universality builds; I better understood why that jumps out so readily. He shows us a variety of characters; in Nadia and Saeedâ€™s tale and in the small anecdotes of individuals spread across the world; then illustrates the common threads uniting them (and us) all; and I loved this way of showing sameness by route of difference. His description of Saeed praying is very illustrative of his overall skill:
When he prayed he touched his parents; who could not otherwise be touched; and he touched a feeling that we are all children who lose our parents; all of us; every man and woman and boy and girl; and we too will be lost by those who come after us and love us; and this loss unites humanity; unites every human being; the temporary nature of our being-ness; and our shared sorrow; the heartache we each carry and yet too often refuse to acknowledge in one another; and out of this Saeed felt it might be possible in the face of death; to believe in humanityâ€™s potential for building a better worldâ€¦
Hamid does allow his characters to become as important as his larger ideas and themes; and I followed with trepidation the acquaintance; affection; alienation and estrangement of Nadia and Saeed as they encounter sectarian war; death; hunger; fear; refugee camps; the anger and kindness of strangers on their journey of migration. Hamid has a light touch of magical realism; as his characters escape via doors from one location to another; not letting their journeys in each location be compromised by too many details of the journeys between each location. Hamid is good at showing connection; a hint of a spark; how love begins in the early meetings between Saeed and Nadia; but he is even better at channeling the complicated feelings of a love grown stale and not nurtured as best it could be; a love being buffeted about by circumstance; and how humans fall out of love with each other as well; and simultaneously hold onto their connections and are dissatisfied with them out of â€œâ€¦the fear of severing their tie; the end of the world they had built together; a world of shared experiences in which no one else would share; and a shared intimate language that was unique to them; and a sense that what they might break was special and likely irreplaceable.â€ I wonâ€™t speak too much more on the plot details and where Nadia and Saeed end up physically or romantically; but most of the worldâ€™s greatest love stories; whether ending for good or ill; together or apart; involve adversity and strife and trials of the highest order; and Nadia and Saeedâ€™s certainly fits that criteria; even if their union doesnâ€™t immediately vault to say Romeo and Juliet immortality. But Hamid makes the love story as compelling as the larger ideas about humanity; which of course is also the point: in our own little lives; we may feel as though we love someone greater than any person has ever loved someone; and when our hearts are broken; we feel devastation and despair so great that no one else could have ever had their heart broken so badly before. But the human experience is a shared experience; and we can (and should; and probably donâ€™t do enough) empathize with each other and rebuild ourselves and our world on the backs of that shared empathy.
â€¦the apocalypse appeared to have arrived and yet it was not apocalyptic; which is to say that while the changes were jarring they were not the end; and life went on; and people found things to do and ways to be and people to be with; and plausible desirable futures began to emerge; unimaginable previously; but not unimaginable now; and the result was something not unlike relief.
This novel is incredibly timely in the wake of Brexit; the Trump election; the horrors of the war in Syria; the plight of refugees in Europe and the deepening of the various fault lines between people; whether by religion or color or orientation. But itâ€™s also timeless; looking at the vast history and fabric of human experience; and ultimately in Exit West and in human life; hope springs eternal; time moves inexorably forward; all things must end and what comes after always can be better than what came before. And in addition to those universal themes; the particular tale of Nadia and Saeed is both a great framework to explore these complex; intertwined ideas; and a beautiful yet bittersweet story of love and loss between two individuals. I was incredibly moved by this read; which I devoured over the course of a few hours; and throughout I found myself constantly marking pages; writing down specific lines and passages; and feeling overcome with emotion. Very much recommend for lovers of literary fiction; who like a quiet but powerful story; and like to be able to step outside of oneâ€™s usual box at the same time as being reminded of our greater commonalities than differences as a human race.

When I read that scene; I immediately thought; yes; looking through a telescope is a perfect metaphor to use in a book that sets out to examine the plight of people whom the majority of the bookâ€™s readers may not otherwise see close up.
If I picked up on that minor scene; it was because I'd been thinking about telescopes in relation to another book about exile I'd been reading; Us & Them; which; like a metaphorical telescope; seemed to bring the far-away near; to make â€themâ€™ indistinguishable from â€usâ€™.
As I read more of Exit West; I was certain I would find similar magnifying power but before long it seemed to me that Hamidâ€™s metaphorical telescope served a different function; almost an opposite one. In the scene in which the real telescope is mentioned; the main character is using it to look at Mars; the second-nearest planet; its features indistinct; the colour of a sunset after a dust storm. The story then moves on and the telescope and Mars are forgotten in the press of events. I would have forgotten them too except that the more of Hamidâ€™s story I read; the more I felt I was viewing it from far away rather than close up. The characters became distant and unknowable; the locations alien and unrecognizable; the pace of the story; odd; speeded up at times; dragging at others. The writing was beautifully clear but the story itself was indistinct; literally as hazy as a sunset after a dust storm.
It might all have been happening on Mars. (less)",468,NEXTBOOK

â€In a city swollen by refugees but still mostly at peace or at least not yet openly at war; a young man met a young woman in a classroom and did not speak for her. For many days.â€
In public; Nadia is always dressed in a flowing black robe; covering every inch of her from her neck to her toes. Saeed has a shadow of a beard; stubble; which he meticulously maintains. They are studying corporate identity and product branding; despite the feeling of impending war.
â€â€¦our eternally impending ending does not put a stop to our transient beginnings and middles until the instant when it does.â€
Time passes; they meet quietly often; affections grow as do other feelings; and there is almost an endless feelings of the push and pull of their relationship; as the push and pull of opposing sides grows ever louder; larger and more present. More time passes; and they feel the need to find a place where they can live without this never-ending fear.
â€Location; location; location; the realtors say. Geography is destiny; respond the historians.â€
And so; they find a way out by virtue of cash; and leave for other shores; but while it is better; it is not the answer. Leaving family; leaving Saeedâ€™s father behind. And so; they leave once more; and things are better; but still it is not the future of their dreams.
â€œâ€¦and so by making the promise he demanded she make she was in a sense killing him; but that is the way of things; for when we migrate; we murder from our lives those we leave behind.â€
Thereâ€™s an element of magical realism that plays in this novel that I never felt I fully embraced. This is where it fell a little flat for me. The characters felt a little too one-dimensional to me; or maybe because they were also not overly likeable; it was not as easy to care about what happened to them. For me.
What did work well for me was the writing; which elevated this enough to keep reading; and also the premise of this novel kept drawing me back in. I kept hoping there was something that would live up to my expectations; and eventually; it did. What I loved most about this story was how all of this wrapped up in the end; a fitting and lovely ending. (less)",469,NEXTBOOK

I am in the camp that finds his writing; his perspective; his understanding of human nature; of history; of lovers; of life; and his run-on sentences (see what I did there?) to be magical. How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia is a book I found to be stunning. Almost no one talks about it. On the other hand; everyone read and talks about The Reluctant Fundamentalist; a novel I found to be fine; but not special. Exit West has a great deal more in common with HTGFR than it does Hamid's earlier work. It is about young people; about openness to the new; about the struggle to forge a new life in a new place; about the response of natives to later arrivals. It is melancholy. It is hopeful.

In beautiful prose; Hamid weaves a personal affecting account of being a refugee with providing a social and political commentary on war; and the deplorable experiences that refugees are subject to in various countries in the west. It begins in the East; a country that to me feels like it could be Pakistan; where the independent and adventurous Nadia meets the more introvert and timid Saeed just as the country begins to slide into a horrific civil war that comes to tragically encroach on them personally. As the violence escalates; leaving their homeland appears to be their only option; the two hear of rumours of the existence of doors; portals that allow them to exit West; an inherently fantastical element that they; amongst so many others; utilise. Narrated by a dispassionate observer; this is a story of war; identity; adapting; love; loss; sacrifice; and what it is to be a traumatised refugee amidst the hostility that swamps them in the countries in which they harbour elusive hopes of safety and security.
The couple go through numerous doors which includes visits to London and San Francisco in California where a large tent city has grown. What Nadia and Saeed encounter in their travels has them questioning who they are and what they mean to each other; exacerbated by the toll that the stresses and strains of their situation place on them. This tugs at the threads of their love and their personal relationship as it begins to fray. Nadia's responses differ from Saeed; she is more adaptable than he is as he sinks into prayers in his search for answers. As the challenges and demands of being in exile; immersed in a world that looks unfavourably on them; it is barely surprising that their love for each other begins to fall apart; although their regard and affection for each other remains; built through the fires of their mutual history.
This is an immensely thought provoking novel; confronting the growing nightmare of anti-refugee sentiments that engulf the west; amidst the ever growing exodus from war torn; dangerous and unstable nations. Refugees face bigotry; racism; riots; death and more. Mohsin Hamid's novel speaks to us of the times we live in and the uncertain and unsettling future beckoning greater worries of greater turbulence. My one regret is that the emotional distance provided by the narrator deprives the story of a more emotional and visceral reality that readers may have connected with more. Otherwise; an exceptional; absorbing and compelling read that I recommend highly! Many thanks to Penguin for an ARC. (less)",471,NEXTBOOK

This is such an amazing book; and despite it being set in a near future; itâ€™s completely current. In fall-into-prose; Hamid tells a love story between two refugees; where doors offer escape from their war-torn country. I love how so many authors are using fabulism in their novels recently; and Hamidâ€™s fabulistic doors offer a unique look into the sudden-ness of being forced to leave home. Exit West is such a bittersweet; human story. I recommend reading it in 1-2 sittings; itâ€™s so easy to become swept up in the prose. Despite the war; loss; and grief the characters experience; itâ€™s still a hopeful read. It makes me think that maybe the world can be a better place; that we can learn to all be human together. I anticipate giving this to many friends this year. Go read it!

Saeed and Nadia; a young couple keeping their relationship secret; escape their war-torn South Asian country (We are never told where exactly theyâ€™re from) through mystical doors that transport migrants from safe place to safe place. The doors appear all over the globe and people step out into new countries easily. But being a refugee is not easy; and they must always be on the lookout; and as they learn to start over and survive; Saeed and Nadiaâ€™s relationship moves through peaks and valleys. I was in a trance while I read Exit West. Mohsin Hamidâ€™s writing is flawless; enrapturing; and left me breathless.

This one isnâ€™t out for some months; but I have to scream from the rooftops about it. The book opens in a city somewhere in South Asia; presumably; we arenâ€™t told where exactly. Saeed; a young; charming; honest man; falls in love with the outrageous and rebellious Nadia. As their relationship develops; Hamid also gives you parallel snippets of their city going to war; and normal life being slowly; and then suddenly; thrown out the window. Some chapters in; the book takes a sharp turn and enters a magic realist tunnel that left me gaping. In a world taken by storm my war and subsequent immigration; Hamid beautifully and poignantly tells us the course Saeed and Nadiaâ€™s relationship takes as they move across the globe.

Mohsin Hamid has created something wonderful with this endearing; and perfectly formed short novel. What an evocative and striking way to discuss refugees; ideological war; tribalism; and love. This book broke through my exterior barriers and nurtured something tender inside of me. It seems for the most part; people are really the same; and we all want the same things regardless of where we come from: security; companionship; and the means to better ourselves. The things weâ€™ve lived through; our experiences; coalesce and form us into who we are; shaping the basis of what we might become.
""We are all migrants through time.""
Windows and doors feature heavily in Exit West. The dangers of the ongoing war between the militants and the government in our protagonistsâ€™ unnamed middle eastern country; enter through windows. As the war grows more serious; every glass pane holds within it the potential to become lacerating shrapnel. The ongoing fighting perverts everything into something it was never intended to be. Windows into shrapnel. Streets into battlegrounds. Characters are killed accidentally through the glass windshields of their cars by misguided munitions. Windows are boarded up; taped up; or obscured for security; limiting the light available indoors.
Doors are where the magical aspect of the story comes into play. Most of the time doors operate as normal; allowing passage from one room to another; from outside to inside; or inside to out. But sometimes; at seemingly random and unpredictable moments; certain doors have started leading elsewhere; to adjacent doors in other lands. Offering a means of escape from local dangers; and passage to the relative safety and wealth of the West. Doors like these are opening up all over the world; and just as the relative size of the world was flattened and reduced dramatically with the invention of the internet; these doors literally fold and flatten the space between the Eastern and Western; Southern and Northern corners of the world. The myriad ways in which this change impacts the societies in the novel was the most interesting aspect of the story for me.
As the effective distance between continents diminishes; the realities of the world that were once far away from the wealthy and fortunate; were once nebulous and ethereal to them; are made vividly real and close. Travel; particularly meeting and interacting with those unlike ourselves; is said to be one of the best ways to overcome existing prejudices and preconceived notions about those from human tribes different from our own. With these doors that have started connecting us; everyone; everywhere has now come into contact with several individuals unlike themselves. Millions begin fleeing from the poorer nations to the richer ones; and this starts to cause a rapid change and instability among the natives of the richer lands.
""Location; location; location; the realtors say. Geography is destiny; respond the historians.""
This change is met with a variety of responses: fear; compassion; intrigue; curiosity; hope; etc. What Exit West does so well is give a glimpse into the daily realities of refugees fleeing from war torn countries; the sorts of terrors they can be running from; the sort of hope they often subside on. It broke my heart; and I think will go a long way toward making me a better; more compassionate person.
In addition to the wonderful social commentary; Exit West is also a love story of the highest caliber; a magically real fairy tale; unafraid to shy away from the realities of love; loss; and the changes quickened or postponed by devastating circumstances. The relationship between Saeed and Nadia grows and expands as the narrative progresses. They are one thing to each other in the beginning and another thing entirely by the end. They meet as students of higher education in their country of origin; and I found it interesting to compare and contrast their story with that of a western couple meeting for the first time at a college in America. In a lot of ways; the extreme situations they find themselves in; possibly hold them together for longer than would be ideal had they been born into different circumstances.
As someone who has never had a similar experience; I found the ways in which Nadia was able to insulate and protect herself in a culture she felt somewhat apart from; particularly interesting. The ways in which a system sometimes inadvertently makes available tools with which we can protect ourselves from that system is a fascinating area to examine. I think it speaks toward the ingenuity of humans to utilize everything that is available to us to better our prospects and secure the future we desire.
""He knew how little it took to make a man into meat: the wrong blow; the wrong gunshot; the wrong flick of a blade; turn of a car; presence of a microorganism in a handshake; a cough. He was aware that alone a person is almost nothing.""
All of my friends who have previously read Exit West specifically mentioned to me that the ending crushed them; brought them to tears or reduced them into a weeping; bumbling mess. It didnâ€™t have that effect on me at all. Instead; I found it unbelievably beautiful; and I sat in contemplative awe; marveling at how perfect the ending was; that the author had pulled it off so elegantly. How in retrospect it was the only possible real ending; and the one I hoped the book would arrive at. It was an evocative; emotionally satisfying scene to finish the story.
To me; Exit West is overall; a hopeful novel; but it touches on deadly serious themes and the brutalities of human existence. I found it moving and beautifully expressed. It is a book that I plan on revisiting many times throughout my life. (less)",473,NEXTBOOK

â€œWhen Saeed and Nadia finally had coffee together in the cafeteria; which happened the following week; after the very next session of their class; Saeed asked her about her conservative and virtually all-concealing black robe.
â€œIf you donâ€™t pray;â€ he said; lowering his voice; â€œwhy do you wear it?â€
They were sitting at a table for two by a window; overlooking snarled traffic on the street below. Their phones rested screens-down between them; like the weapons of desperadoes at a parley.
She smiled. Took a sip. And spoke; the lower half of her face obscured by her cup.
â€œSo men donâ€™t fuck with me;â€ she said.â€
Reading her response was a surge of power.
I continued on excitedly and became quickly invested in the narrative and the smooth switching point of views. I especially enjoyed how the story shifts from focusing on Saeed and Nadia to introducing swift tales of other character perspectives while stepping through a door that can whisk them far away from their homeland. The language in those stories was in particular eye-catching. And I cherished how it gave us a broader look on a vital topic such as migration.
But circling back to the main pair in this book; I was fascinated to follow the relationship and journey quiet and devout Saeed and fiercely independent Nadia undertook through their shifting positions in life after the imminent fall of their city. From students to lovers to migrants to survivors; and so much more... It was powerful and refreshing to witness.
And this quietly beautiful moment stands out most when I think of them:
â€œHer leg and arm touched Saeedâ€™s leg and arm; and he was warm through his clothing; and he sat in a way that suggested exhaustion. But he also managed a tired smile; which was encouraging; and when she opened her fist to reveal what was inside; as she had once before done on her rooftop a brief lifetime ago; and he saw the weed; he started to laugh; almost soundlessly; a gentle rumble; and he said; his voice uncoiling like a slow; languid exhalation of marijuana-scented smoke; â€œFantastic.â€
Saeed rolled the joint for them both; Nadia barely containing her jubilation; and wanting to hug him but restraining herself. He lit it and they consumed it; lungs burning; and the first thing that struck her was that this weed was much stronger than the hash back home; and she was quite floored by its effects; and also well on her way to becoming a little paranoid; and finding it difficult to speak.
For a while they sat in silence; the temperature dropping outside. Saeed fetched a blanket and they bundled it around themselves. And then; not looking at each other; they started to laugh; and Nadia laughed until she cried.â€
I was moved and strengthened by this passage.
However; their relationship hit a bit of a lull about halfway through the book for me when it was seemingly going nowhere in particular. And then also in terms of plot or character develemopent there wasn't anything exciting on the table. But once the book managed to move from that rough spot; I was all the more enraptured.
All in all: Exit West was an impactful read about war and migrants and nativists while also veering into themes of love; desire; and religion.

Mohsin Hamid never loses sight of the important factors of his story: his characters and their interactions; he doesn't stray from the emotional heart of this story to make a point; and he writes with a precision and beauty that is absolutely breath-taking.
This is Nadia's and Saeed's story; from their first meeting in an unnamed muslim country on the brink of civil war; to their subsequent journey to places that are hopefully safer. These two form and their ill-timed relationship are the core of this novel.
Mohsin Hamid uses his brilliant premise (what if there were suddenly doors all over the world leading to other places?) to explore the emotional impact of being a refugee instead of the logistical impact. He can ignore the hardships of travelling over land to other countries that are safer; to focus instead of the intimate experience of being foreign - of being a stranger in a strange land without having wanted to be that. I adored this. I thought this focus worked really well and made this story something really special.
He has a unique way of structuring his sentences that I found beyond brilliant. He made me reread sentences and reread passages. This is where this book truly shines: It is unbelievably beautifully written and breathtakingly structured. His command of his story-telling voice is beyond impressive. While I thought his characters were vividly painted and their relationship believable and heartbreaking; they are not what I will keep remembering. But I think that is ok - because while their story humanizes the book; it is both universal and personal in a way that kind of renders the characters irrelevant in the broader scope of the work.

It could be just a meh book and the narration can be so wonderful it catapults the book to the tops of lists. Then; there is the other side. And this is where that book falls for me.
I was so looking forward to this one and grabbed the audio. Sorry; but I will just say it was not for me. The narrator; the author himself; spoke in very short; halting sentences. I have no idea if that is how the print was or not (oh I hope it was not). I could not concentrate. Any other book; I would have shut it off immediately. But I kept pushing as I really wanted to like this one (forced reading never ends up a favorite of anyones) and I'm going to hear the author speak about this book later this year. But in the end; I found the story line boring. It seemed all over the place and I didn't understand; or care; about the doors. Again; chalking this one up to the audio.
I'm going right down the middle with my rating. I am going to give the print version a shot after I hear the author speak. Perhaps without the frustration of the audio; the print will flow better for me. I've seen so many wonderful reviews on this one and how wonderful the prose was.

Mohsin Hamid has written a poignant; thought-provoking love story amidst the worldwide turmoil of conflict; disharmony and its horrendous consequences of displacement. These two themes are dealt with in a wonderfully balanced and fluid way; which illustrates Hamidâ€™s clever writing skills; and is a clear observational overview of today's world.
The story initially starts in an unknown Middle-East country (unfortunately there are several real countries/cities that could fit the description). Saeed and Nadia meet as students; and their relationship develops slowly; with the brakes of religion and independence holding it back. Saeed wants to wait until they are married before consummating their relationship; while Nadia is a very independent woman who isnâ€™t indoctrinated into religion and doesnâ€™t follow traditions unless it is to ward-off male advances. Mohsin's writing creates such wonderful imagery and sense of personality; especially within this relationship. I loved the dynamic and illustration where Saeed fought for celibacy outside marriage and Nadia was the open-minded person; challenging the controlling restrictions of religion; morals and society.
The city they live in gradually escalates into conflict forcing Nadia to move in with Saeed and his father for safety. After living for a period scrambling an existence; the only sensible option is to leave their home through magical; transportation doors; that lead to other regions. The narration creates a graphic insight into how a civil war creeps up on the residents; with a foreboding and fatalistic feeling that lives and dreams will be shattered. It is difficult to run from the home you have always known to a place that is alien and unwelcoming. Saeedâ€™s father decides to remain; knowing it most likely means death; but at least he will be home and near his beloved deceased wife.
As refugees; Saeed and Nadia arrive in places where they are unwanted and treated with disdain; loathing and persecution. The couple manages to maintain their relationship throughout; moving to Mykonos; then London; and finally to California; always hoping for salvation; always Exiting West. There is an irony in the locations of UK and USA; as both have recently experienced a public electoral decision that wishes to take drastic steps to prevent immigration and refugee support. A hugely relative and emotive issue that sets in motion policies of division and isolation in a world consumed with war; genocide; migration; bigotry and racism.
(view spoiler)
The story had a strange end; as both the relationship between Saeed and Nadia; and the refugee crisis both seem to run out of pace. It does; however; leave us with a renewed sense of hope for humanity to build a better world. (view spoiler)

It's sad
It's a post Brexit world

Saeed and Nadia ... the two heroes. From the East going to the West. The language is beautiful and fluid; romantic with not much dialogue which sucked to be honest.

I have to admit I missed something here with Exit West and for that I am disappointed with myself; definitely not with the book though. I don't think I got the full enjoyment that many other readers did from this book because of feeling like I did miss out on something.
I just keep thinking I should've felt more; understood more or had more insight into my reading experience than I did. Maybe it was my expectations. Not sure.

There was something so addictive about this book; it felt at times distinctly young adult while also having moments that felt so well done it was beyond the stereotype of what a teenage thriller tends to be. Itâ€™s taken me 4 days just to collect my thoughts to the point that I can attempt writing a proper review; and Iâ€™m certain this will be one of the most talked about books in the YA genre this Spring/Summer season. My issues with this book were minor; and Iâ€™ll get to those later; but when I first picked up this book I knew I would enjoy it based on the description stating â€œBreakfast Club meets Pretty Little Liarsâ€; two things I love to pieces. While this was in some ways a traditional whodunnit; I believe many of the minor influences were the reason this novel reads so well.
According the the books Iâ€™ve logged on Goodreads; Iâ€™ve managed to read over 700 mystery; thriller; and suspense novels. That is an overwhelming number of books that tend to be fiercely judged on their ability to provide a solid; mind-blowing twist. The reason I mention this is due to the fact that it is very difficult for me to pick up a mystery and not have it solved in the first 10% if the clues are provided; otherwise; I typically pick it up when said character is first introduced into the narrative. One of Us Is Lying is bound to be one of many fabulous novels that gets thrown into that category and is scrutinized solely by itâ€™s ability to keep the reader guessing â€œwhodunnitâ€ until the big reveal. Again; I mention this because I think it would be a grave mistake for the reader to be so focused on this aspect when the book has so much more to offer! Personally; I had it figured out in the first chapter. As stated in the summary; the pieces are there for the reader to put together if they are clever enough. I applaud the author for her cleverness and storytelling abilities; there will be many readers who will be fooled by the red herrings and receive that glorious AHA moment at the big reveal. Why am I rambling on about this you ask? I really want to drive home the point of what makes this book stand out from others that are similar.
The Characters. It is a rare day indeed that I find fleshed out; grounded; relatable characters that draw me in to a young adult narrative the way that these did here. My AHA moment may not have come during the big twist; but it certainly came in waves abounding throughout my experience journeying with these various high school kids. I was sure this would be another read with those stereotypical teenagers that give contemporary YA novels a bad rep; for crying out loud the stereotypes are printed on the inside of the book cover in the description! I think this was a clever move by the publisher and author; if other readers pull the same underestimation as I did; they will be more than pleasantly surprised at what they get out of this book. In referral to the wrapping up of characters and not the twist; the ending was one of the best Iâ€™ve seen in awhile. There is no gag worthy happily ever after where everyone is perfectly paired up in couples and they ride off into the sunset on their baby unicorns while the sun beats down on their pimple free facesâ€¦. No; while there are some upbeats moments; the ending is messy and real and I welcomed it whole heartedly. People made mistakes beyond the central narrative and there were consequences and some things were left open-ended in the way that makes you wonder what their eventual decisions lead to. Iâ€™m extremely pleased that the author chose to take some risky leeway with her writing direction and applaud her with a standing ovation.
Alright; I said I would get to the minor issues and I kind of lied. Please donâ€™t hate me; but there was a tiny aspect of this book that I thought I could get past; and even though I canâ€™t discuss it outright (because these spoilers involve blowing the entire plot of the book); my conscience just wouldnâ€™t let me finish this review without mentioning them in the broadest of terms. Again; I applaud the author for tackling some really tough issues and concerns in this book; and I donâ€™t think she wrote anything wrong on her end. I think itâ€™s more of an issue Iâ€™ve seen present itself across a wide number of YA books recently. Some who may be dealing with mental illness may perceive the outcome of this novel in an unrealistic way and I can see the possibility of various readers being split on their opinions of some of the content presented. I will say; I feel it was handled better in this book than in others I have read previously. As always; if youâ€™ve read this book early or once you have a chance to read it and would like to discuss; please feel free to private message me and Iâ€™ll gladly have a respectful chat with you.
This is a review Iâ€™ve been struggling to write for a few days now and I hope Iâ€™ve done it justice. There just arenâ€™t words to describe how completely readable this book really is. McManus did such a fabulous job of making me just as interested in the individual secrets and side stories of the â€œMurder Clubâ€ as I was in the central mystery surrounding Simonâ€™s death. The author had me convinced that this couldnâ€™t possibly be her debut novel; and if this is what she has published first; I can only imagine the treats we will receive in written form from her down the road. Iâ€™m a committed fan now and I canâ€™t wait to see what she publishes next. Highly recommended to teens; sure; but I think loads of adults are going to enjoy this one as well. Thereâ€™s something really special and unique to this story that defies the boundaries of age gaps and will have me remembering it for months to come.

If One of Us Is Lying was a television series; I would binge-watch it wholeheartedly. It's been a while since I've gotten so into a book I've devoured the majority of it in one sitting when I haven't been on a plane. This hooked me completely; and I'm surprised how much I liked it.
Five students have detention one afternoon. There's Cooper; the golden boy and star baseball player trying to decide between college and the major leagues; Bronwyn; the class valedictorian who plans to follow her family's legacy and go to Yale; Addy; one-half of the picture-perfect couple and a homecoming princess; Nate; the bad boy; on probation for dealing drugs (and still selling them not so secretly); and Simon; the despised (and kind-of feared) creator of About That; Bayview High's gossip blog. They're all in detention for something none of them did; and they can't understand why the teacher doesn't believe them.
Before detention is over for the day; Simon is dead; and apparently; it wasn't an accident. It's not long before investigators discover that the next day; Simon was planning to publish items about Cooper; Bronwyn; Addy; and Nateâ€”items which could potentially destroy all of their lives. Suddenly the four of them are the suspects in Simon's murder; and are pariahs among their fellow students; most of whom hated Simon until he died; then turned him into a tragic figure.
Suddenly four people who weren't really friends (or at least since childhood) are brought together. Each claims their innocenceâ€”but is one of them lying; or did someone else get involved? And how; when it was just five of them in the classroom that day? Can they clear their names and get their lives back?
It turns out that Bronwyn; Cooper; Addy; and Nate all have secrets they'd prefer to have kept hidden. In some cases these aren't even the secrets that Simon threatened to expose. But when the truth is revealed it will impact their relationships with each other and their friends; as well as their futures. Can they handle it?
Karen McManus did a great job with this book. It's amazingâ€”she basically took most of the typical high school stereotypes; yet gave her characters a little more depth than you'd expect. Even though you probably will have suspicions of how the plot will unfold (and most of those suspicions will be correct); it's still interesting the way McManus pulls everything together. I couldn't get enough of this book; and even though the story wrapped up; I wouldn't have minded if it ran longer.
This was a great read. And let's put it this way: only for a novel as skillfully written as One of Us Is Lying would make me willing to relive memories of some of the angst; emotions; drama; and insecurities of high school. (And since you know so many books have me singing a particular song; for no reason whatsoever; this book had me singing ""One of Us"" by ABBA. But this was an easy one: the song actually has the lyric ""One of us is lying."")

I finished this book with the biggest cheesiest grin on my face; I donâ€™t even know what plane of existence that was but there were a lot of corny feelings involved (any planets I can blame that on??). Itâ€™s like I was floating on a cloud or something. I was overwhelmed with so many emotions for no reason and I guess my cotton candy heart just went off!!! I wish at least it was raining so at least I could go stand in it for the drama!!
Ok seriously. I need $$ not feelings *squashes my emotions with my bare hands*
So as I was saying; this book was just so good; so cinematically; tangibly exciting; so FULFILLING TO THE CORE and Iâ€™m willing to bet that if someone threw it off a cliff; I'd probably dive after it tbh!!
Itâ€™s a universal truth that I am actually and unambiguously and inappropriately obsessively 100% full scale high key addicted to reading crime books and watching crime documentaries and having in-depth knowledge of incriminating shit. My aesthetics would just be capsule hotels and forever I can just chill in a padded bubble and read thrillers or watch crime shows
Which is why I was so excited for this book and boy; it did not disappoint!!
what is this book about?
Basically that after reading it; Iâ€™ve decided that Iâ€™m living my life until someone frames me for murder; which wonâ€™t be so hard to achieve since I spend so much of my time alone that if I was ever falsely accused for a crime I would literally never have an alibi. Besides; I wonder how long before a personâ€™s viewing history and library receipts can be used against them in court like; â€œthe defendant has stacks of crime books and had viewed 46 straight hours of crime shows before the murder occurredâ€¦ sketchy; your honor. sketchy.â€
Iâ€™m actually just kidding. Please if youâ€™re connected to me in any way; never commit any crime I donâ€™t think I can deal with the stress of a police interview and if I get falsely accused; I will probably just fucking start bawling!!
Anyway; back to the book.
I honestly donâ€™t know what the hell to tell yâ€™all that won't be spoilery; so just know that I can't wait to have kids so I can make them read this book and realise the repercussions of getting detention (i.e being framed for murder.)
honestly though; this book was just so?? fun??
â€œShe's a princess and you're a jock;"" he says. He thrusts his chin toward Bronwyn; then at Nate. ""And you're a brain. And you're a criminal. You're all walking teen-movie stereotypes.â€
The characters seemed like puppets attached to a string; as if the entire plot was just this girl playing on her phone and theyâ€™re all her neko atsume cats dying because she got bored of the app.
And so?? angsty??
â€œThese murder club meetings are becoming a regular thing. We need a new name; though.â€
I existed as both a teenager and a wealthy 18th century middle aged woman who needs to lie down for hours after anything remotely distressing happens while reading this. Really. I had one foot in a psychiatric breakdown and the other one in unattractive slippers trying to solve this.
But I TOTALLY GUESSED IT and I think itâ€™s due to the fact that I'm morbid and too angsty and I am always aware of all of the worst worse things that could possibly happen at any given time. Itâ€™s like constantly being held hostage by hypothetical situations.....ok jesus fine don't look at me like that; I guessed it by the end but listen; I would've guessed it earlier if I wasn't busy obsessing over a CERTAIN OTP!!!!)
The characters:
I think my biggest shift in perspective has been going from â€œcan I pay the universe a bribe to never send me any of these characters as real life peopleâ€ to being like â€œwow Iâ€™d take care of you and care about you so hard!!â€ So that just goes to show you what a spectacular character development theyâ€™ve undergone. I literally love them so much and it might seem like my whole life currently revolves around them but yes it does!!
Also did I mention that Nate is my favorite?? bc he is; I mean he's the kind of guy you date to disappoint your parents but if someone is willing to throw stones at their girlfriendâ€™s window so she can climb down the conveniently placed tree and go make out in a car; you bet they're my fav.

This book was such a disappointment because I was REALLY enjoying it up until the last 3rd or so. I seriously thought this would be a 4 or 5 star read. However; upon finishing; I strongly believe that this book should not have been published as is. It's ignorant and damaging.
Aside from the parts that I found harmful; the writing was very trope heavy and relied on too many stereotypes for character development. I didn't think there was anything new here. The one thing I did like about the book is that McManus did build suspense well and kept me guessing. She casts suspicion on so many characters that you start questioning everything. This would have been a good mystery if it hadn't used people's identities for shock value. This is othering. These are some 90s plot twists that I'm honestly surprised flew by a publishing team in 2017.
I'm going to talk about these things in depth under the spoiler tag below because I know everyone has a different threshold for what they consider to be spoilery. I personally don't think these things should be written as spoilers; but that's how this book treats them so it's how I'm treating this review.
(view spoiler)
For those who may be hurt by the mishandling of sexuality or mental illness; I would suggest being cautious of this book. If you're a reader who is oblivious to or unhurt by bad rep; you'll probably enjoy this book going by all the shining reviews it has.
Other things of note:
-Bronwyn is biracial (white & Colombian).
-Addy's POV is very shallow and portrays a terrible relationship and girl drama. (But she has a good growth arc.)
-The drug-dealing bad boy trope is heavy.
-The audiobook narrators were great at their jobs.

THIS BOOK!! You guys; I thought this book was brilliant! So many great elements all thrown together.
- murder mystery
- high school drama
- secrets; both big and small
- suspicion
I love a murder mystery anyway; but this one was made better as I cared about the 4 kids who were suspects.
The star of the baseball team harbouring a huge secret.
The Prom Queen who has never been able to find herself as a separate person from her long term boyfriend.
The rebel with previous criminal convictions - the obvious suspect.
The goodie two shoes. Surely sheâ€™s never broken the rules?
All 4 end up in detention with Simon Kelleher; the guy who runs a gossip app that ruins reputations with its secrets. All four of them have a secret to hide and would do anything to keep it hidden. But at what cost? Because by the end of detention Simon is dead; but who did it?
â€Some people are just too toxic to live.â€™
I was absolutely addicted. I couldnâ€™t put it down until I found out the answer. Plus there are so many tropes that get walked all over. My personal favourite THE GIRL WITH GLASSES GETS THE HOT GUY! This literally never happens in books or films so thank you Karen McManus for including this and not making her take them off â€to be prettierâ€™
I loved Addyâ€™s character development too. In the beginning she was just some jockâ€™s girlfriend with no thoughts of her own. By the end of the book she really became her own person and I LOVED THAT.

So; if you like those shows; books like those shows; books those shows are based on; etc.; then this is the book for you. While not the most complex mystery I have read; it is quite a bit of fun.

Because I think I just experienced that shit; dude.
My heart is literally beating so fast from this thrill and mystery and feels fulfilled with something heavy called satisfaction. I haven't been so content and had screamy feels over a thriller since Dangerous Girls; which was 213324 decades ago.
Tbh; it's so hard to find a thriller that literally has you on the edge of your seat; biting your nails; screaming at and suspecting everyone; saying ""WHAT THE FUCK"" every 3 pages; wanting to flip to the last page to find out who dunnit because you're so fucking full of it and can't stand the mystery and suspense.
It's so hard to find a thriller that's actually???? thrilling???
Well; I can 99% gaurentee your search has come to the end because let me present to you this book which lives up to the damn hype and everything you can possibly want in a thriller.
What it's about:
You; you're a murder suspect and all your secrets are gonna be exposed; have a nicE LIFE!!! Want a cookie? :))
Ight; seriously; these 5 kids get in trouble and have detention where they're talking and it's all detention stuff when one of the kids starts choking and having an allergic reaction. he's taken to the hospital and later the four kids find out he dies. His death is all suspicious and now all four of 'em are suspects and we need to figure who dunnit and who's lying.
â€œShe's a princess and you're a jock;"" he says. He thrusts his chin toward Bronwyn; then at Nate. ""And you're a brain. And you're a criminal. You're all walking teen-movie stereotypes.â€
Addy; Nate; Cooper and Bronwyn are incredible characters; imo. After being put under suspicion; the four of these learn so much about themselves and make decisions that is best for themselves and for everyone. It's heartbreaking and sad to learn about what they hide; but spoilers so read it and find out yourself; thanks. :)
No but seriously; these are the type of characters; I wouldn't associate with at all when first reading about them; but like???? honestly; I'm willing to turn myself in if it means having them free and unharmed. i love them so much oh my god.
Can we talk about how precious Cooper is? This kid; without a doubt; is my favorite. i love this precious cinnamon roll so much.
^yes bro; this is an actual footage of me caught hugging Cooper; bYE.
Also; I guessed it oh my god. I think it's because I'm so obsessed with non fiction crime and murder or probably because I'm just plain morbid??? But even though I had my predictions; I was shook when that ending happened; son.
Overall; this book is so fucking precious and I totally recommend. (less)",492,NEXTBOOK

(By the way; besides the detention-concept; the story is completely different from ""The Breakfast Club""; so you don't need to fear that this is some cheap knockoff!)
All the main characters get introduced within a few pages right at the beginning. I often find this rather problematic; as I easily get confused by many characters entering the scene at once; and I then have trouble telling them apart. This was not the case here! I surprisingly was able to tell them apart easily and developed a picture of them in my head right away.
I fell in love with all of them and their different personalities. Besides the main plot; everyone has a personal and interesting storyline as well. They all live/lived through some not so nice things; but none of them play the victim. They have realistic views on their situations and aren't delusional. I was so happy about that! It often ticks me off when I see teenagers acting like little children in YA-novels; so it was nice to see something else for once.
Actually; there were many opportunities to go down the typical YA-route; but thankfully that didn't happen. I was very (pleasantly) surprised at that!
Sure; there were some (very) minimal cheesy scenes; but I (unexpectedly) found them rather cute; and not annoying and unnecessary like I usually do. There are also kept on a small scale; so the attention never drifts away from the main plot.
All of the characters go through some personal growth throughout the book. This growth is done realistically; nothing is over the top or too unbelievable.
My personal favorite was Addy - I truly had a soft spot for her! Her individual storyline and development is something so important. I was rooting for her the whole way through and was cheering her on at every step of the way. I'm sure that they are people reading this book who are in the same situation as her; and I really; really hope that their eyes might be opened with the help of Addy's portrayal.
The title obviously keeps you guessing throughout. The level of suspense was perfect and I never knew who and what to trust and believe. I kept thinking about possible solutions even when I wasn't reading. I thought I had discovered every possible solution; but I was still surprised at the end!
There is only one small thing I have to complain about: I would have liked a little bit more insight into Simon's life. But to be honest; I'm not even too bothered about this though; as all the fantastic things definitely outweigh this small issue.

Yet things are off from the start; all of the kids claim that the cellphones that landed them there didn't belong to them. When one of them suddenly collapses from an anaphylactic attack; things get even stranger. Now Simon; the boy who had that anaphylactic attack; is dead and everyone in the room is a suspect when the tox screen comes back and it becomes clear that someone purposefully gave him peanut oil.
Uh spoilers probably?? ok most likely I can't really shut up so. Anyway I really enjoyed this one. It reminded me of one of those CW shows; and like I've said before; that is something I'm totally into. I just totally felt like a teenager again while reading this; in a good way; and that was fun. I even liked the ending here and I'm usually pretty eh about endings most of the time. It was a happy ending but it also felt real enough that I wasn't vomiting from how amazing everything was. I can't stand saccharine sweet endings. I mean I wish Nick hadn't pushed Bronwyn away after he gets out of jail but it felt like a really consistent reaction when considering the rest of his behavior in the book.
Also I really liked how each character's POV felt like an individual new person. I think a lot of times when authors have multiple POVs it feels like all the voices sort of blend together and sound too similar. And can I just say I really lobed Addy's growth as a character; like yes fuck your dick head boyfriend. Speaking of which the whole Jake thing was pretty fucked up. Once they started talking about Simon posting on 4chan on school shooting threads; I knew he set it up; but I totally didn't see the Jake thing coming. I also don't even know what to say about that because like what a huge fucking overreaction honestly; like just cause your girlfriend cheats on you doesn't mean you let someone who was your friend kill themselves and then frame her for it jesus fucking christ.
I also saw a bunch of reviews about the portrayal about sexuality and mental illness; and I'm not trying to disqualify anyone else's opinions or feelings but personally I didn't find it consistent with my own reading of the book. I don't think the author ever really slut shames; like the villain is the one doing it and it's clearly not endorsed. Also the homophobia wasn't glorified either. The picture of mental illness it paints isnt that nuanced but this book reads like pretty little liars or something and I wasn't really expecting it to have some conversation inducing portrayals of those things. It plays up on the drama and stereotypes and I guess thats not enjoyable for everyone but I personally liked it and just read for the enjoyment aspect more than much else. (less)",495,NEXTBOOK

â€œSome people are too toxic to live. They just are.â€
Welcome to detention; where a princess; a jock; a brain; a criminal and . . . a gossip???? Wait; thatâ€™s not historically accurate . . . . .
Have all earned a spot for violating one of the most serious rules of high school: NO PHONES IN CLASS. Theyâ€™ve done the crime; now they have to do the time as well as write a 500 word essay about how technology is ruining American high schools. If they fail to do so; well . . . .
Plans quickly change; however; when the gossip drops dead of anaphylactic shock. (He didnâ€™t belong in the story anyway; right? The basketcase was the final member.) Now the four remaining delinquents are all suspects in his death when the questions of just how did peanut oil get in the disposable cups near the sink and what happened to all of the epi pens in the nurseâ€™s station get raised. But thereâ€™s even more in store for these kids when the gossipâ€™s dishy blog starts revealing secrets none of the four ever thought would get out . . . . .
First; kudos to whoever was in charge for finally getting a dang blurb right. This absolutely was â€œThe Breakfast Club Meets Pretty Little Liars.â€ Per usual; I was not the target audience for this selection; but hey the sun shines on an old dogâ€™s butt every once in a while because I thought it was . . . .
I suspect One Of Us Is Lying will become a bestseller P.D.Q. (thatâ€™s pretty darn quick for you youngâ€™ins) and I wouldnâ€™t be surprised to see it optioned as a movie in the not-so-distant future either. If you read mysteries . . . like ever . . . . you'll probably see the end coming about 12 miles away; but the getting there is all the fun. Obviously this isn't a story thatâ€™s going to change anyoneâ€™s lives; but if you have a teen (or in my case a 30 year old male attorney boss) who enjoys all the guilty pleasures Pretty Little Liars has to offer on the ABC Family Channel; this will probably be a winner.

One of Us Is Lying was fasted paced; fun; and very addictive. Once I picked this book up I could not put it down. It also served as a pallet cleanser after The Handmaid's Tale. I needed something fun and lighter in tone(yes I know its about the murder of a teenager).
At about 100 pages in I developed a theory about who was behind the crime and it turns out I was right. All my years of watching SVU; Criminal Minds; and 48 Hours have not been in vain. I should probably quit the Library and become a PI or Bounty Hunter; I'd be amazing at it.

The writing is engaging and accessible. The story itself is narrated by the four main charactersâ€”Bronwyn; Addy; Nate and Cooperâ€”; thus keeping things moving at a fast pace.
I was very curious about this book. How can one not be; when hearing the premise? Five students walk into the detention room and only four come out? I love these kinds of storiesâ€”like And Then There Were Noneâ€”in which everyone is a suspect and no one is to be trusted.
But I was disappointed with the story. I never felt thrilled and I never felt mystified. Thatâ€™s the problem: this book doesnâ€™t make you feel anything. And the way I see it; itâ€™s a requirement for mysteries/thrillers to make you feel something. Otherwise itâ€™s just a book like any other. You could say that I wasn't as invested in One of Us Is Lying as I would have wanted to be.
I liked how different the characters were from one another; even if they are complete clichÃ©s. The synopsis makes that perfectly clear from the start. However; as the story progresses; we discover new facets of their personalities. I cared for the future of each of them; but I wouldnâ€™t go as far as to say that Iâ€™ve never met anyone like Bronwyn; Addy; Nate or Cooper. Because again; clichÃ©s.
If this is one of the first YA mystery novels that you read; I guess thereâ€™s a chance youâ€™ll enjoy it more than I did. Honestly I just canâ€™t stop thinking of better YA mystery novels than this one. But thatâ€™s because Iâ€™ve read many of them.
Here are some recommendations:
- Dangerous Girls
- Dreamland Burning
- All the Rage
- City of Saints & Thieves

â€œUnless one of us is lying. Which is always a possibility.â€
Oh me oh my; this book was not what I expected at all.
I hadn't looked into the plot too much so I was going in half blind in a way.
I was thinking this would be The Breakfast Club 2.0.
But I was wrong.
I thought this was going to be yet another YA Contemporary novel with predictable plots.
But I was wrong.
This book was so gripping and I flew through the pages like it was no tomorrow.
From start to finish I was on the edge of my seat and trying to figure out the murder like a was on an episode of Law and Order.
And if I'm going to toot my own horn here; I figured out who the culprit was around the half way mark.
Detective Taylor; at your service.
But in saying that; the way the plot was constructed still left me surprised by the end of the book.
So sneaky...
I will mention that this story heavily focuses around harassment; mental abuse and homophobia.
So if you're quite sensitive around these topics; just be mindful.
I try and make all my reviews spoiler free as it's just easier for review purposes (who am I kidding? I'm just lazy lol) So I won't go into too much detail.
But the story focuses heavily on 4 Students:
Bronwyn; Cooper; Nate and Addy. And like the Breakfast club; they are all completely different students but unlike The Breakfast Club; they turn to each other for support because they have all been involved in a murder they have just witnessed together.
And let me just say; these students were so fantastic.
â€œI guess we're almost friends now; or as friendly as you can get when you're not one hundred percent sure the other person isn't framing you for murder.â€
I really connected with them and my heart got heavy for them in so many ways.
I was angry; upset; excited and felt that I was going to burst into confetti at any given moment.
I think Karen M. McManus did a fantastic job with this book.
The style of writing; the plot with all the twist and turns that left me guessing in most parts; was just SO GOOD MAN!
Kudos to you; Karen!
I'll be thinking about this book (especially the ending because fuck man; I almost died. Twice.) and will pick this book up again in the future.
So if you're yet to read this and in the mood for a bit of teenage mystery. Pick it up. You'll thank me later...

i got to the bottom of this and figured it out pretty easily early on; but that didnt detract from the story in the slightest. initially; i was worried this was going to be too much like the breakfast club meets murder she wrote but; other than the student stereotypes; this wasnt like that at all and i was so glad.
i loved how entertaining this was. i appreciated the little twists and turns; here and there; that kept me on my toes whilst i was so focused on the big end reveal. i also thought this was especially impressive for a debut - stories like this are pretty common; so it quite ambitious to try to make it your own; but i thought mcmanus nailed this. it had great pacing; solid writing; an engaging plot; and interesting characters. and i also now have a new book boyfriend in the form of nate; so thats always a bonus!

â†’ what i liked â†
This is a very quick read; if I had enjoyed it; I'm sure I would've knocked it out in one sitting. As it was; it still felt like it moved pretty quickly.
The main romance is fairly cute. Incredibly trope-y ""goody-two-shoes smart girl falls for the brooding bad boy!"" stuff; but; I mean; their interactions are fine; and I was rooting for them by the end of the book; which is a big plus. I would say I was more attached to the budding relationship between them than I was to any of the individual characters in this story.
Nate; 'the criminal'; is a very likable character. He's got a really dark and twisty back story that explains away a lot of his motives; and I definitely enjoyed his perspectives of the story the most. He just feels like a really authentic teen who's trying to muddle through a hard; screwed-up life; and I loved that about him. Whenever it was any other character's POV; I definitely found myself rushing to get back to his sections.
â†’ what i didn't like â†
This book is so problematic and most of it is NEVER challenged. First of all; can we talk about the immense amounts of slut-shaming? I could handle it if it was coming just from the characters and/or was actually being challenged consistently; but 1) it isn't challenged every time in the dialogue; and 2) the author contributes to the slut-shaming narrative regarding women cheating.
We have two characters in the story who are cheaters; one is a female character; who does it one time; while drunk; the other is a male character; who carries on an emotional and physical affair for MONTHS. We spend a tremendous portion of the book focusing on the girl's one-night-stand; while the text literally does not ONCE actually name the boy for what he is: a cheater. There's no remorse shown; and there are no consequences whatsoever for him. It also seems kinda gross to me that the girl who's guilty of cheating is a ""pretty; vapid; popular girl"" type - can we please stop with these cliches?
Also; can we please NOT make the only queer character in the cast a horrible character who cheats and hurts people? AND can we not make the character's coming-out scene a bigger twist than the actual murderer reveal? This book also does some serious vilifying of mental illness; but I won't get started on that rant.
Beyond all of that... honestly; the writing is just not that good; and the ""twist"" is so predictable it hurts.
â†’ final thoughts â†
All in all... I almost hated this book. If it hadn't been for the quick pace and how much I enjoyed Nate; as well as his relationship with Bronwyn; I absolutely would have DNFed this. As it stands; I cannot in good conscience recommend this book; and I will probably not be picking up any future releases from this author. (less)",501,NEXTBOOK

A few minutes later 1 of them is dead. Who killed Simon?
I've been wanting to read One of Us is Lying for awhile now. I am a hug fan of tv shows like Riverdale and Pretty Little Liars and teen movies like Breakfast Club; Sixteen Candles; Mean Girls; Can't Buy Me Love; Scream; etc. I could go on & on. It's pretty bad - I can't flip through the channels and see any of those on without watching. Therefore; it's no surprise that this book seemed like a perfect fit for me. I'm not even sure why it took me this long to read it.
One of Us is Lying isn't a very complex mystery. I had it figured out from the beginning. Well; admittedly I can't say I had all the angles completely figured out but the main twist - I called it right from Ch.1. Usually; that would ruin things for me but this time I didn't even mind it. I knew what I was getting into with this YA mystery and I was definitely along for the entire ride. ;)
This book was better than a daytime soap opera! Seriously; EVERYONE was lying or hiding something from everyone else. Yet; I genuinely cared about these kids. These 4 SUSPECTS - they captured my heart. I loved how they grew throughout the story. Addy - who I found spineless and whiny in the beginning completely won me over by the end. I was literally cheering her on - OUT LOUD! Nate - who doesn't love the misunderstood; brooding bad boy rebel! What's not to love about sweet as Pie Cooper? Finally; Bronwyn a.k.a Miss Goody-two-shoes reminded me of me. Obviously she was my fave! I enjoyed watching these 4 form an unlikely alliance and band together to figure out what really happened.
Here's the thing - even though I had the whodunnit mostly figured out; there was a twist that I hadn't seen coming. That made reading the book even better than I initially expected. Is the book a bit cliche? Yes; but that's what makes it fun & a bit nostalgic. Does it depend on stereotypical characters? Yes; but don't they often do that? I felt like these characters showed growth from beginning to end which you don't often get to see in YA mysteries. What some might see as negatives I saw as positives for this book. It was fun; nostalgic; engaging and extremely readable. It held my interest from beginning to end. (less)",502,NEXTBOOK

Thank you to the author; Karen M. McManus; and the publisher; Delacorte Press; for this opportunity.
After a typical day in a typical American high school; five teenagers enter detention but only four make it out alive. Simon; notorious due to his gossip-style blog that revealed all the dark and dirty secrets his fellow students never thought would see the light of day; had made many enemies. But which one would want to see him dead?
The multiple perspective all provided their own angle to the plot. These all pulled together; towards the end; to turn their individual stories into one cohesive whole. Each dirty secret that was uncovered made each character less of a walking stereotype and more of a flawed; and therefore real; individual. I will admit that when I first was introduced to this cast of characters - the overachiever; the bad boy; the jock; the popular girl - I had assumed these were going to be nothing more than a set of weakly constructed and overused cardboard characters. How wrong could I be?
The actual plot was a thrilling and interesting one; but it was the characters who circled it that really compelled me to keep reading. I admit that I figured out the mystery pretty quickly; but this didn't detract from my enjoyment in any way; purely because the characters. With their flaws and their individual insights they continued to interest me; and made this a very real and very suspenseful read.

""Right?""
This book was a pleasant surprise! It was refreshing and a change from the usual young-adult contemporary.
Bronwyn; Nate; Cooper; and Addy are suspects for murdering the school's gossiper; Simon. When the 5 of them were in detention; the last thing they expect is for Simon to drop dead... Unless one of them planned the whole thing.
The story is told from their POVs. The nerd; the bad boy; the jock; and the princess are the most common high school stereotypes. Until you start to see they're more than that. Bronwyn has the highest grades; Nate was (is?) a drug dealer; Cooper is the best baseball player in school; and Addy is used to being popular; true; but these are more than their just titles. Soon; you sympathize with them but at the same time; you can't neglect anything they do/think. Everyone has secrets that they'll do anything to not let them see the light; but at what cost?
Everyone is flawed. We see them transform from 1-dimentional characters to teens with more developed personalities as they try to deal with everything. Bronwyn and Nate's chapter were my favorites; although I have to admit how much Addy grew on me. Cooper's were fun. Most important of all; they're real .
Even though the mystery wasn't hard to figure out; it was still fun. I'm sure it's because we're seeing the bigger picture; everyone had a piece of the truth. Yet; you can't help but feel skeptical; I shouldn't like this character; he looks innocent but what if ?
One of the things I liked is how this book relies on social media; something many books set in our days ignore. It's not logical; social media is a part of everybody's life. I liked how Karen used it to create a good story. How our lives; privacy; secrets are violated. How it's so easy to uncover anything.
This was a quick read; even if I have to admit that it stretched a bit too much eventually. It was fun and a page turner. I highly recommend if you're looking for something new in the YA contemporary genre. It has a bit of everything; even a little romance.
This book would make a great movie! Karen M. McManus did a great job for a debut book; I'm already looking forward to reading her future books.

Five go to detention. Four come out alive.
Simon: Is basically gossip girl without the secret identity
Broneyn: Nerdy girl with a rich family
Nate: Has a reputation and a criminal record
Cooper: The baseball player with more scholarships to count
Addy: Has the perfect boyfriend and life ahead of her
Let me try that again:
Simon: Who is tired of never being accepted by the popular crowd
Broneyn: Whoâ€™s only goal is to get into Yale and will do anything to get there
Nate: Who always takes the hit of anything because of his past
Cooper: Who has a bar to make but a secret that could limit his reach
Addy: Who doesnâ€™t have a personality without her boyfriend
I absolutely loved this.
This was written amazingly. I kind of saw how that would end. Like why the person was killed and why he did it; but it didnâ€™t make it less enjoyable. There were so many webs being weaved and it was just so captivating.
Addy and Cooper were my absolute favorites.
If you are looking for a drama-filled; murder mystery set in high school thatâ€™s got romance and rebellion and secrets beyond reason: youâ€™ve found your book.

More of my reviews can be found at www.thecuriousadventuresofkat.wordpre...
Oh what a tangled web we weave.
When first we practice to deceive.
And oh; what a tangled web we have here. But first; I gotta say Karen McManusâ€™ One of Us Is Lying legit gave me so many Pretty Little Liars feels itâ€™s ridiculous. I mean; just look at the title alone. Anyone else find themselves singing the Pretty Little Liars theme song whenever you glanced at the cover? Just me? â€œOne of us is lying and one of us is dead.â€ Not the exact words; but it fits this story. So. Unbelievably. Well.
More seriously; One of Us Is Lying is uncannily similar to Sara Shepardâ€™s blockbuster series. Both plots thematically center around deception. The lies we tell others and the lies we tell ourselves. And how those itty bitty untruths shield us from a reality weâ€™re too scared to confront.
In One of Us Is Lying; each of our four main characters is hiding a secret they fear will shatter their meticulously constructed personas. Weâ€™ve got Bronwyn; the brain; Addy; the perfect homecoming princess; Nate; the criminal; and Cooper; the all-star baseball player. Theyâ€™re joined in detention by Simon; creator of the schoolâ€™s infamous gossip app. Five high-schoolers in detention. Sounds like a pretty standard premise; right? WRONG. When detention ends; five students exit but only ONE leaves in a body bag. Simon dies of a fatal allergic reaction to peanut oil planted in his drinking cup. Rumor has it; the following day Simon planned to reveal each of our protagonists' deepest; darkest secrets. All four students wanted Simon gone. All four students are hiding something. But only one is a killer. BUM; BUM; BUM. To recap: basically; weâ€™re looking at a mashup of PLL and Gossip Girl with a dash of The Breakfast Club. But fear not: this is no pale imitation; instead One of Us Is Lying is an intelligent; fully-realized thriller in its own right.
And oh; what a thriller it is. To say this book is compelling is a vast understatement. One of Us Is Lying is unputdownable. Thoroughly addicting. The story benefits greatly from employing alternating narrators. Sections are short affording the book an unrelenting; brisk pace. And yes; I was THAT girl in the movie theater feverishly reading until the filmâ€™s opening sequence.
But a fast-paced plot is only part of the bookâ€™s appeal. Really; itâ€™s the characters that distinguish One of Us Is Lying from its contemporaries. While initially the students seem straight from a John Hughes flick (a point humorously referenced in the story); One of Us Is Lying diverts expectation by endowing each teenager an actual personality. Layers for MILES. Karen McManus delves into the recesses of her protagonistsâ€™ brains; reveling in their complexity. Plot and character are equally developed and prized. Ultimately each student is transformed by the bookâ€™s events. Here; itâ€™s not just about the whodunnit; but how the whodunnit affects individual people. Think Tana French for the Bieber generation.
I really canâ€™t say enough good things about this book. One of my (useless) skills is correctly guessing a storyâ€™s whodunit. And while I prize this talent; it can make reading mysteries a predictable enterprise. But One of Us Is Lying stumped even me. I was shocked at the denouement. A rare occurrence. One drawback: there is a tad too much exposition when the Big Bad is revealed. However thatâ€™s a feature even the great Agatha Christie failed to avoid.
To sum up: well-rounded characters; an intriguing plotline; and effective prose. I canâ€™t wait to see what Karen McManus does next. Highly recommend. (less)",507,NEXTBOOK

All the tropes I normally hate are represented: the misunderstood bad boy; the not-so-good good girl; the popular girl ready to break out of her clique; and the jock with secrets. They come together in a murder mystery when Simon; the school gossip who ruins his classmates lives by airing their dirty laundry on his app; is murdered during detention. The four other students in detention with him become suspects in his murder; especially when it comes out that they were all next on Simon's hit list.
There's nothing surprising or inventive about this story; and the twists and turns aren't all that difficult to see coming down the path. I didn't take it seriously at all as a murder mystery; which is one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much. By embracing its tropey-trashy-YAness; the book allowed me to do the same. I devoured it in a matter of hours; and it proved to be a fun distraction.

Please ignore all comparisons of this book to The Breakfast Club.... and go into this book with an open mind....
The only similarity to this book and that fabulous 80s movie is these five very stereotyped teenagers spend some time in detention together... this is where the similarities end.... and I mean this in a good way.... I really enjoyed this book....
Loved all these characters..... and I really wanted them all to be innocent.... it was fun and interesting to see all the character growth in all of them stemming from this tragedy..... they all had secrets to hide; but ultimately I think they found strength in each other....
I really donâ€™t want to say too much... but I didnâ€™t see the end coming until quite late in the book.... and it still surprise me some....
Absolutely recommend whether you are a fan of young adult or not.... any age this is a fabulous book filled with wonderful characters and twists and turns..... Who is lying? (less)",509,NEXTBOOK

McManus. It was published on 5/30/17 by Delacorte Press; an imprint of Random House; 368 pages. The genres are young adult; contemporary; thriller; and mystery. It is intended for readers ages 14 and up; grades 9 and up. This book is the authorâ€™s debut.
My Experience: I started reading One of Us is Lying on 9/13/17 and finished it on 9/16/17 at 1am. This book is an excellent read! I couldnâ€™t put it down! This book wakes me up at 4AM and nudges me to read more even though I had to force myself to put it down at 11:15pm earlier to sleep. I love the stories of the individuals and the pace the secrets are being revealed. Their individual lives are interesting to read. I enjoyed the plot and the characters a lot! I really like probation officer Lopez and her always looking at the bright side. I like Addyâ€™s sister Ashton. I like how she encourages Addy to move on.
This book is told in the first person point of view; starting out with 5 students meeting each other at the high schoolâ€™s detention room. They all believed they were being set up. The school has a no cell phone policy in the classroom and each of them were caught with a cell phone in class. The five are Nate Macauley who has been in trouble with dealing drugs; Bronwyn is the nerd in the school who had to skip her mathlete to attend detention; Addy Prentiss is the homecoming princess who doesnâ€™t make her own decisions; Cooper Clay is the baseball star at the school; and Simon Kelleher who is a creator of the gossip app called About That. All the students in the school either feared or hated Simon because he exposes their secrets on About That. The secrets are known to be truth even without proof. Few minutes into detention; 4 students walked out of the classroom and 1 was driven away by an ambulance. Police investigation reveals that Simon was targeted one day before he was to post on About That an entry that will expose all 4 studentsâ€™ deepest secrets. This concludes that all 4 students has motive to hurt Simon.
This book is very well written and easy to read. I love the diversity of each character and their individual backstory. I feel sad for Nateâ€™s childhood. I like Addyâ€™s story because it exposes how women can lose themselves when they rely on their men too much. I used to be jealous of those girls with boyfriends like Jake who treats Addy like a queen; but after reading this book; Iâ€™m not jealous anymore haha.. Maybe itâ€™s better I buy what I like for my birthday instead of getting what the guy chooses haha.. Cooperâ€™s view is interesting and heâ€™s so mysterious with his secret. Bronwynâ€™s view is okay. Her secret is not even that bad. I was thinking she did something worse. I love the humor in this book as well as the fast paced. I highly recommend everyone to read this book! Itâ€™s definitely a fun thriller to read!
Pro: cover; diversity; fast paced; page turner; couldnâ€™t put down; suspense; secrets; humor; adrenaline rush; romance
Con: none
I rate it 5 stars!

I really don't do well with the avant garde. I want a plot; I want a story. I want character development. This offers none of the above. I felt lost. Vague memories of Ionesco and Beckett kept cropping up as I tried to plough through this. The book alternates between reading like a thesis; full of quotes from â€œotherâ€ sources and then almost more like a play. Ghosts come and ghosts go. They each have their own little mini-story but there is little continuity. Some ghosts appear more often; Blevins and Vollman act as narrators; moving the meager story forward. The Rev. Thomas provides a glimpse of a sort of Revelations style individual reckoning. There are sections that are enticing or interesting. But they are small glimpses of jewels.
I am clearly in the minority here. All the wonderful reviews had me doubting myself. But in the long run; reading is all about pleasure. And this book brought me very little of that.

The back of the cover description tells a poignant detail about Lincoln which Saunders in the Q&A tells us was the thought that formed for him the heart of this story. At the time of his 11 year old son Willie's death by typhoid fever; it was reported that Lincoln went to the crypt at night to hold his son's body. The grief that one can almost feel in that image is the essence of this book and has been fully and imaginatively depicted. The grief - this book is so filled with Lincoln's grief; it will break your heart. While this is told in such a unique way; it took me only a few pages to be pulled in. But the grief became overwhelming at times and I had to put it down for a break once in a while.
The first thing I did before I decided to read this book was look up the definition of bardo. "" (in Tibetan Buddhism) a state of existence between death and rebirth; varying in length according to a person's conduct in life and manner of; or age at; death. "" (English Oxford Dictionary) I'm glad I did because most of this mixed narrative is comprised of the voices of the dead including Willie who are in the bardo. These conversations are interspersed with excerpts from historical texts mainly describing how they saw Lincoln suffering this tremendous loss; and as mentioned in the Q & A with Saunders; some of the excerpts are imagined. It's impossible to tell which are real and which are created as I read them. I decided not to look them up but to accept Saunders' creative license . This is a novel; albeit not a straightforward telling.
I thought it was a fascinating way to tell the story not just of the death of Willie but it is in many ways a commentary on the man who was president during a trying time in our history; a commentary on the time; but also on life and death. I recommend this to those who are open to something very different and very moving.

His head is pounding to the beat of a song with a faster tempo than what he hears seeping through the floorboards from below.
He...canâ€™t...breathe.
It feels like a fat man is squatting on his chest.
His father comes to see him. His eyes are hollowed out cinders. His skin is stretched tightly against his face. He hovers over him like a disembodied skull. His beard tickles his cheek releasing a flood of memories of being held; being indulged; being love.
His mother comes to see him. Her pretty dress rustling like a cat moving through the river rushes. Her breathing is constricted. He wants to ask her to loosen her corset; but what passes through his mind never makes it to his lips. Her eyes are pinched with worry.
He dreams about his pony and wonders when will he be well enough to ride him again.
Heâ€™d cry; but he is too tired to cry. Crying leads to weeping; and weeping leads to coughing.
And then something unexpected happensâ€¦he dies.
That isnâ€™t supposed to happen. His father is clothed in immense power. Some might even say he is the most powerful man in the world. How can this be?
Fix it; Daddy.
â€Great sobs choked his utterance. He buried his head in his hands; and his tall frame was convulsed with emotion. I stood at the foot of the bed; my eyes full of tears; looking at the man in silent; awe-stricken wonder. His grief unnerved him; and made him a weak; passive child. I did not dream that his rugged nature could be so moved. I shall never forget those solemn moments---genius and greatness weeping over loveâ€™s lost idol.â€ Keckley; op. Cit.
Lincoln had already lost one child; Eddie; back in 1850. Was he punished for his own indulgence in sadness? Heâ€™d paid his price for his melancholy. Was Willie a payment for the war? Was this his blood gift? His sacrifice to save the Union? Where was his reprieve; like the Abraham from the Bible? God didnâ€™t say; stay thy hand. He let the reaper do his work.
â€The saddest eyes of any human being that I have ever seen.â€ Joshua Wolf Shenk; account of John Widmer.
They buried the boy in Oak Hill Cemetery.
Lincoln came to see him; cloaked in darkness.
Willie is there; sidestepped away from his carapace. He is trapped in the bardo; held by the love of his father; as he watches his father weep; holding the body so tenderly taken from his sick box.
The Tibetan word bardo means literally ""intermediate state""â€”also translated as ""transitional state"" or ""in-between state.""
Willie would go; but his father said heâ€™d be back.
There are other trapped souls there in a form of purgatory; snared by their own fears at what awaits them in the next world.
â€And yet no one had ever come here to hold one of us; while speaking so tenderly.â€ Hans Vollman
â€œEver.â€
Roger Bevins III
As various forces vie for the soul of young Willie; and Lincoln is exactly who we expect Lincoln to be; the Civil War rages in the background; and Mary Todd Lincoln finally lets loose the bonds of her mind and goesâ€¦ briefly mad. As much as Lincoln would love to swim in the bitter; black soup of his own depression; the fate of a nation lies squarely on his shoulders. He cannot falter. He cannot grieve freely as a father should. In the darkness of night; among the gray black tombstones; he can for a time let loose the torrent of his tormented mind.
George Saunders has written a book in a style I have not encountered before. He mixes quotes from journalists with observations from people who were there; and with ghostly comments from those trapped between worlds. It makes for a heady mix of snippets that weave themselves into a whole cloth story. Obviously; to write a book like this he has to research the material as if he were writing a nonfiction book. I can almost envision this moment when Saunders is looking at the notecards tacked to his wall; each containing a quote that he wants to use in his novel and thinking...this is my novel.
I do have to give Saunders creative points for the concept; but there is a part of me that thinks that this is a short story specialist who is trying to find a way to write a novel. Clever little bastard that he is; he pulls it off. As we listen to the ghosts and the people surrounding the tragic events of Willieâ€™s untimely death; we also hear their stories; and though few can claim the extent of tragedy that finds the Lincoln family time and time again; there are some absolutes that govern everyoneâ€™s life. No one gets out of this life unscathed. Once you experience love; you will experience loss.

EVERYONE loves it. Nope; not me. I actually hated it. I've heard people say they wanted to throw a book across a room and I never understood that desire to harm a book; but for me; this is one to throw. I should know better than to read a book in which the review says something like ""an alternative writing"" ""a different way of telling a story"". That just means it's weird; no plot; no character development; an author trying something new that works for others; but not me.
This is not historical fiction; this is not even a novel; this is a series of short paragraphs that are only semi-linked. This book is not about Lincoln; so if you're a President Abraham Lincoln lover; you will likely not like or appreciate this book. There's no story here. I read reviews in which people said they were moved to tears over Lincoln's sorrow. Huh? It's a bunch of ghosts talking to each other who don't even know they're dead.
I hated all the voices and I hated the short quotes from people who were supposed to be there. Some of these were real quotes and other were made up. Even this bothered me; either use all real quotes or make it completely fiction. I felt like I was reading George Saunders spiral notebook where he was jotting down his notes and footnotes; it was just a list.
There were over 160 narrators voicing the audio book. This could have been cool; and for those listeners who love this book; will love this idea as well; but because I hated it; it bugged me that so many great actors; authors; narrators; got pulled (suckered) into this mess. David Sedaris; Megan Mullally; Lena Dunham; Ben Stiller; Susan Sarandon and the list goes on.
I realize I stand alone and the rest of you will love this book. Go ahead; love it. We will connect on a different book on a different day.

I had a lot of resistance to read George Sanders again.
""The Tenth of December"" was the number 1 best seller for months and months.....
Everyone seemed to 'LOVE' it. OUTSTANDING they all said. NOT FOR ME....I didn't understand the hype. It was 'alright'.....but not 'wow' for me by any means.
I remember thinking another 'lesser name' --- at the time --RISING today--was the OUTSTANDING collection of short stories -that people ought to be talking about .... by Peter Tieryas Liu for his book called ""Watering Heaven"".....
A collection of short stories that 'still' blows me away to this day! -- The stories all that place in China. Brilliant book!
So....In order to break through my George Saunders resignation--I had to do a ton of homework before investing my actual time and money - on the physical book and audiobook.
NOTE: I'm the type of reader who usually doesn't need to read more than the blurb. I prefer going into a book almost 'blind' - as long as my gut feeling towards it is thumbs up.
Yet - when in doubt - it takes a bulldozer to get through me.
A cyber bet - of an imaginary coin toss - which I won - finally made me realize - I'm not getting out of reading this book ..... so I simply surrendered!
AND MY GOLLY.... THE HYPE IS REAL!!!! It's really REAL!!!! This book is OUTSTANDING ..... IT 'is' at times like a Greek Chorus ......
The spirit-souls in the graveyard---where Lincoln temporarily buried Willie --- narrate
in clear unflinching prose. I had prepared myself to struggle following the different ghost voices. The surprise was - I had little problem with the structure. It was clear as a spotless window....that many of these voices were already dead souls. I personally found their backgrounds fascinating.... ( the good and bad people who had died - their crimes - their personalities- their belief that they might return to life.... after all -- they haven't completed their death yet).
A few times I thought of ""The Book Thief""; by Mark Zusak; with the unusual narrator; Death....because at the time -- I felt it was very effective - profoundly imagined.....
Now; comes ""Lincoln in the Bardo""... taking the unusual narrator/narrators to a whole new level - beyond the universal so to speak..... death; grief; and love.....mixed with history of the times......and moving on ... and letting go ... and letting go ... and letting go........ A father's love for his son ---the grimmest of prognosis --hurts deeper than hurt.
GEORGE SANDERS created a deeply emotional beautiful heartbreaking journey.
There is nothing typical about this book. It's extraordinary!
NOTE: Having the PHYSICAL BOOK to read the words is powerful - 'and' the AUDIOBOOK is magnificent. -- great combination. The voice of Lincoln is wrenchingly felt in your gut! Other voices are 'awesome' .. some very modern and contemporary-- others ancient and old feeling --others quite playful..... some faster than the speed of light 'a sentence' spoken.
2nd NOTE: If a parent has recently lost a child - this book could either be impossible for them to read or perhaps it's a comfort. But they would need to tread cautiously.
However....I think this is not only an masterful book - but an important one...'needed'!
We've needed this book written! (less)",515,NEXTBOOK

4.5 Stars
How does one review a book such as this one? No words could possibly truly convey the potential journey a reader is embarking on when they open this novel. This is certainly nothing like any other book Iâ€™ve read; in concept or in style.
Before I requested this; I looked up several references to the definition of the bardo; both the Tibetan definition and how itâ€™s meaning carries beyond the definition. Bardo is the â€œin-between placeâ€ a â€œtransitional state;â€ the period of the afterlife between two states â€“ our former â€œrealityâ€ is no longer; the bardo seems much like a waiting space before you enter into your next phase of â€œlife.â€ I would say this applies to the bereaved; as well as the deceased. Your former life has changed; and a period of time must pass before one may move on to the next phase; rebuild.
William Wallace Lincoln; the third son of President Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln; had been sick off and on since the beginning of the year; as had his brother Tad. On February 20; 1862 at 5:00pm; Willie died â€“ most likely of typhoid fever. Willie was eleven years old.
After Willieâ€™s death; Abraham Lincoln often visited the crypt where Willie was interred; which continued for months. Holding him. This fact is the basis for this novel.
The majority of conversations throughout Lincoln in the Bardo are between the deceased who remain in the bardo. The conversations are sometimes more like ramblings; sometimes multiple inputs from the others that are often more a cacophony than harmonious choir of thoughts. Willie waits among them; waiting for his fatherâ€™s return. Lincoln; in his grief; is in his own state of waiting; his mind unwilling to accept the reality.
Amidst all of the conversations are excerpts of historical texts regarding Lincolnâ€™s behavior; his suffering. Some are letters sent to the President regarding the War from grieving parents. Some are compassionate and lovely. All paint a picture of an unbearable loss. Lincolnâ€™s loss. The loss of the families whose sons were fighting in the war; or who had fought and were never coming home.
Having never read anything by George Saunders before; I am a bit in awe of the thought process that went into this rather astounding and poignant debut novel. I loved this; despite heartbreaking moments; it is strangely wonderful; the brilliance behind it still shone through.
Recommended.

Wholly inventive; imaginative; the amount of research staggering; something totally new and different. Will admit having some trouble in the beginning; couldn't see where the author was going with this; wondering if it was gong to progress; it did in a very interesting way. Not going to rehash the plot; the description only loosely defines this. The book is helped along by some very unusual narrators; Vollmam and Bevins; along with a Reverend that can't figure out why he wasn't let in the pearly gates. There is a cast of many others; all with their own stories to add to the mix.
This novel takes a little patience; a willingness to embrace the unusual and an imagination that lets one see outside the norm. I though it was brilliant.

The writing was exquisite and I was amazed at the brilliance of the author; but there were also long sections where I felt completely lost.
The tide runs out but never runs in. The stones roll downhill but do not roll back up.
What I'm about to write doesn't even begin to sum this book up! President Abraham Lincoln's beloved eleven-year-old son Willie passes away after an illness. However; Willie doesn't realize he's dead. His soul is stuck in a transitional phase along with the other ghosts who populate the cemetery. On the evening of the funeral; Lincoln returns to the cemetery and cradles his dead son's body. The ghosts are amazed at the rare scene of a tenderness towards the dead. Lincoln leaves; but promises to return. It's unwise for a child to stay in the transitional realm for long; so some of the ghosts attempt to usher Willy into the next realm. Willie is determined to stay and wait for his father; so the ghosts must concoct a plan to convince him to move on.
Trap. Horrible trap. At oneâ€™s birth it is sprung. Some last day must arrive. When you will need to get out of this body. Bad enough. Then we bring a baby here. The terms of the trap are compounded. That baby also must depart. All pleasures should be tainted by that knowledge. But hopeful dear us; we forget. Lord; what is this?
George Saunders is always recommended to me when I mention my love of Helen Phillips; and now I know why! The storytelling is surreal and the imagery is bizarre; sometimes grotesque. Lincoln in the Bardo is both humorous and devastatingly sad. This 368-page book is actually rather short on words (the audiobook is only 7 hours and 25 minutes). Part of it is like a play and the other part is constructed from excerpts of other sources; both real and imagined. Hans Vollman; Roger Bevins; and Reverend Everly Thomas serve as our guides in the transitional stage between life and death. The form these ghosts take relate to unresolved issues at the time of their death. Hans Vollman died before he was able to consummate his marriage; so he walks around naked with a massive; swollen ""member."" Roger Bevins became hyper-aware of the world's beauty right before his death; so he's covered with eyes; hands; and noses. In a sad twist; these ghosts don't realize they are dead; they refer to their corpses as ""sick-forms"" and their coffins as ""sick-boxes."" They believe they will resume their lives eventually.
One feels such love for the little ones; such anticipation that all that is lovely in life will be known by them; such fondness for that set of attributes manifested uniquely in each: mannerisms of bravado; of vulnerability; habits of speech and mispronouncement and so forth; the smell of the hair and head; the feel of the tiny hand in yoursâ€”and then the little one is gone! Taken! One is thunderstruck that such a brutal violation has occurred in what had previously seemed a benevolent world. From nothingness; there arose great love; now; its source nullified; that love; searching and sick; converts to the most abysmal suffering imaginable.
It was really interesting how fact and fiction work alongside each other in this story. I was amazed at how Saunders juxtaposed pieces from various sources to create a complete picture; especially since many of the reports are contradictory. Some of the historical chapters were especially memorable:
1) Conflicting descriptions of the moon on the night of Willie's death - There's something beautiful about the unreliability of our memories.
2) Descriptions of Lincoln's appearance - He's described as an ugly man by many; but those who are more closely acquainted see him a little differently.
3) Criticism of the Lincoln during the Civil War - I couldn't help but think of the modern day while reading the intense and sometimes vulgar criticism of Abraham Lincoln. One of the detractor's comments would've been right at home in a YouTube comment section!
I was in error when I saw him as fixed and stable and thought I would have him forever. He was never fixed; nor stable; but always just a passing; temporary energy-burst. I had reason to know this. Had he not looked this way at birth; that way at four; another way at seven; been made entirely anew at nine? He had never stayed the same; even instant to instant. He came out of nothingness; took form; was loved; was always bound to return to nothingness.
The heart of the novel is the strength of the bond between President Lincoln and Willie. In one interview; Saunders mentions the idea for this novel started with a vision he had of the Lincoln Memorial and the Pieta combined. That image came through crystal clear in the text; because the first thing I thought of when Lincoln holds is son was Michelangelo's PietÃ . The pathos permeates the pages. Willie's intense need to be close to his father broke my heart. I felt the immense weight of both grief and the presidency on Abraham Lincoln's shoulders in a way that I've never gotten from my nonfiction reading. As he grieves for his beloved son; he agonizes over the decisions he has made as president. He was intellectually aware of the casualties of war; but there's a shift in him as he's forced to deal with the loss of his own son.
We had been considerable. Had been loved. Not lonely; not lost; not freakish; but wise; each in his or her own way. Our departure caused pain. Those who had loved us sat upon their beds; heads in hand; lowered their faces to tabletops; making animal noises. We had been loved; I say; and remembering us; even many years later; people would smile; briefly gladdened at the memory.
I enjoyed the idea of visiting with the other ghosts more as a general idea than in practice. There were so many characters and I didn't have patience for all of them. Maybe it was that we didn't get to spend that much time with them. Most of the time I wanted to get back to the Lincolns. A combination of the strange imagery and each ghost's distinct nineteenth-century speaking style made some of their voices difficult for me to read. The style was sometimes so opaque; that my mind couldn't penetrate it; sometimes I was just reading words; unable to extract any meaning from them. It didn't help that the names of the speakers were placed after they spoke; especially with the longer passages. Perhaps that's less of a concern in audio (distinct voices) or print (easier flipping). The hype around this book intensified my frustration. I checked the average rating after a sixty-page struggle and had one of those ""Oh crap! I'm the only person in the world that doesn't understand this!"" moments. If you hit a section that makes you feel more frustration than transcendence; you're not alone! I'm not saying any of this to discourage anyone from reading it; but to help anyone who is having similar struggles. It was worth it for me to continue through my frustration because some of my favorite moments are at the end; when Lincoln wrestles with decisions about the war.
Pale broken thing. Why will it not work. What magic word made it work. Who is the keeper of that word. What did it profit Him to switch this one off. What a contraption it is. How did it ever run. What spark ran it. Grand little machine. Set up just so. Receiving the spark; it jumped to life. What put out that spark? What a sin it would be. Who would dare. Ruin such a marvel. Hence is murder anathema.
All that being said; there were exceptions. I was touched by the woman who worried about the three daughters she left behind and the stories from the black contingent of ghosts was highly relevant. Some of the most heartbreaking scenes were watching the ghosts cycle through forms they were never able to realize. I've never felt more confronted about the transience of life or how our physical bodies are just temporary vessels. Tomorrow is never a guarantee; but it's easy to forget as we live our day-to-day lives. There's so much to learn from these ghosts as we see how they view their past lives and learn about their regrets. Somehow everything looks completely different once there are no more chances! I was hopeful that the inhabitants of the cemetery; including Willie; would be able to make peace with themselves and find a way to complete their journey.
He is just one. And the weight of it about to kill me. Have exported this grief. Some three thousand times. So far. To date. A mountain. Of boys. Someoneâ€™s boys. Must keep on with it. May not have the heart for it. One thing to pull the lever when blind to the result. But here lies one dear example of what I accomplish by the orders
I don't always have the easiest time with ghost stories; but the way these ghosts affect President Lincoln reminded me of the power of reading--how it allows the voices and experiences of those real and imagined; dead and alive shape who we are and influence our viewpoints. As the weight of new experiences overwhelms President Lincoln; a stronger empathy and sense of purpose arise in him. He knows what he must do to preserve the union. Under the disapproving eye of a nation; we watch as he comes to the steadfast conclusion that the ""the swiftest halt to the thing (therefore the greatest mercy) might be the bloodiest."" (Hans Vollman's words)
Reading this novel is a wholly unique experience. It's brilliant and emotionally powerful; but sometimes confusing (for me). My lack of star rating is not the same as zero--it's just an indication that I can't fit this book in any kind of rating system! One; two; or three stars seem too low because there were parts that I was amazed by; but four or five stars doesn't seem honest to my overall experience.* This book is hard to compare to anything else. As far as oddness; eerie atmosphere and the depth of emotion I felt; I was reminded of The Buried Giant by Kazuo Ishiguro. For a more resoundingly positive review; I recommend reading Colson Whitehead's analysis in The New York Times and watching the ""immersive narrative short"" at the end.
Edit 3/20/17: Decided on 3 stars. I liked it; but not overwhelmingly so.

Clearly; I'm swimming against the current on this one. Having read some convincing reviews; I thought it must be included in my TBR this year. Well; I almost tossed it aside 100 pages in and probably should have and not given it a rating.
This is a read of loss. A parent - president Lincoln - has lost his 11 year old son to an illness.
The bardo - is the place between heaven and hell - a purgatory of sorts. It's a story of ghosts; and of Willie; who are stationed between life and the afterlife - the conversations that take place; the longing of missed ones; missed lives.
I can't give it the kudos others have - for me it was overwrought with too much sadness; despair and ghostly spirits. The writing was fragmented with quotes and no quotations.
Maybe I'd have been more sympathetic had I been American and able to relate to some history? Likely not.
I thought as I forced myself to read this; it might be easier to be among the dead than forcing myself to continue on; but I really didn't want to be stuck in some sort of hell with similar characters.
Ok that was harsh - it did have an interesting twist on death and did make me wonder in those short hours just after we lose someone; does this space exist? And did remind me of the accountability we each hold living this human life the best we can.
BUT; there was really no plot; little character development.
I'm glad to be done and returning this back to the shelf where it can sit with other ghostly (ghastly) weirded out stories.

I started and stopped in fits; but one massive read in a single sitting was the way for me to go on this; allowing it to crash and wash over me completely; and get acquainted with the style and be fully receptive to the ideas expressed here. Once submerged in the unique format; I was incredibly moved by the way Saunders is able to link the singular sadness and pain of one man losing his son (one great; historically critical man) to the comings and goings and suffering and salvation of all. This read was a force of nature for me: random; unexpected; bold; brilliant. It was unable to be fully pinned down into thought or analysis by me; but so easily appreciated and awed by its power and beauty. A full 5 stars for me; and likely to be my favorite read of the month (if not the year); as it's continued to haunt me since finishing it.
All were in sorrow; or had been; or soon would be. It was the nature of things. Though on the surface it seemed every person was different; this was not true. At the core of each lay suffering; our eventual end; the many losses we must experience on the way to that end. We must try to see one another in this way. As suffering; limited beings - perennially outmatched by circumstance; inadequately endowed with compensatory graces.
The particulars are a matter of historical record and the book blurb: eleven-year-old Willie Lincoln has passed away and been laid to rest in February 1862; and amidst turmoil and war and death of the increasingly bloody Civil War; his father; President Abraham Lincoln; visits Willie's tomb and spends a night with his son's body. The novel focuses on that one night; as Willie's spirit is in the bardo (the space between life and death; lingering between states of reality). We're given a historical and cultural context and contemporary views of Lincoln; his family; and his performance as President and as a father to help us better understand his guilt; his loss; his suffering and his strength on that evening via a selection of quotes from actual biographical sources and those Saunders has imagined and created to better strengthen his portrait of the President in 1862. Fact and fiction weave together to display a complex view of Lincoln; compounded by getting into the President's mental space as he holds his son's corpse in the tomb.
All over now. He is either in joy or nothingness. (So why grieve? The worst of it; for him; is over.) Because I loved him so and am in the habit of loving him and that love must take the form of fussy and worry and doing. Only there is nothing left to do.
Willie is not in the bardo alone: a veritable Greek chorus of spirits accompanies him; urge him to move on while simultaneously rejecting their own status of death and clinging to the beauty; large and small; of life. It's this Greek chorus that helps round out the universality of Saunders' novel: Willie as one soul among many; all important; all meaningful; all moving toward the same fate and state. But the spirits are also individuals; even if they say similar things: each has their past and their death; a manner of speaking and a way of dealing with their bardo state. There's humor and introspection; ribald pronouncements and dark truths; trite obsessions and larger worries that come to the forefront with this group of spirits from backgrounds rich and poor; black and white; the array of personalities and issues in death as varied and interesting as in life. Those in the bardo must decide on this evening who is to ascend to the next state and leave behind their ties to their earthly existences; and who shall remain; and many look to Willie and his father as a means to connect with their own loved ones; while others take pains to help Willie move on; and Lincoln to be at peace with the loss of his son (and the deaths of the young men and boys on the battlefield; of Union and Confederate forces alike; and the captivity and dehumanization and death of the American slaves that also weigh on his conscience).
He was an open book. An opening book. That had just been opened up somewhat wider. By sorrow. And-by us.
...Taken! One is thunderstruck that such a brutal violation has occurred in what had previously seemed a benevolent world. From nothingness; there arose great love; now; its source nullified; that love; searching and sick; converts to the most abysmal suffering imaginable.
This is a novel that really brilliantly weaves the details of Lincoln's life in 1862 and specific pain of the loss of his young son; with larger themes connected to all humankind; past present and future; of our particular and universal fate; the horrible and yet beautiful ""trap"" of life and death; death's inevitability and unpredictability; and the glorious nature of love and pleasure and beauty and peace that a human life can contain is both tainted and yet more deeply beloved for that simple fact. You are a wave that has crashed upon the shore; repeat visions that implore souls in the bardo to move forward. And so too has Saunders' novel utterly crashed upon me; a brilliant; breathtaking meditation on the human experience: grief; life; death; and all in between. A hypnotic; powerful; entirely memorable read that I recommend to any and all who live and love and lose; as we all do.

â€”Dante (Purgatorio)
There really; really must be something wrong with me.
Many of my esteemed Goodreads friends; whose rave reviews I put a lot of faith in; are smitten with George Saunders' book. It's even won the blimmin' Booker Prize for crying out loud!
Um; where to begin? *he says; wringing his hands in the manner of a doctor delivering bad news*
I tried my hardest to like it; I really did - in the same way I once tried to like green smoothies; until I came to the realisation that a nice cup of Earl Grey was a far better option!
Booker Prize; or no Booker Prize; I would be lying if I said that I enjoyed this irksome offering. A patchwork quilt of musings; transcripts; obituaries and purgatorial grumblings does not (in my humble opinion) form a novel.
Sandwiched somewhere between Saunders' rectangles of anecdotal nonsense is a soulful; heart-rending human interest tale that deserves to be told. I rather hoped that he would give up on this clunky gimmick and get on with writing something resembling an actual story but; alas; he continued in the same vein until the bitter end.
This; to me; was the literary equivalent of scrolling through someone else's text messages (except I would have derived more pleasure from reading someone else's text messages). And why do some ghosts even bother to self-censor their swear words with dashes? Whose delicate sensibilities are they worried about upsetting? Everybody's dead anyway! It's so f--king annoying!
I apologise to everyone who has swooned over this body of work. There is a very good chance that my antipathy might betray a complete lack of good taste and understanding on my part.
In fairness; I do see this working better as an audiobook; or as a stage play.
But as a novel?
Nope; not for me. Not in this lifetime anyway.
Sorry.

The unusual format; like oddly punctuated and inverted lines of a play; was fine by me. It just took some adjustment; and then it was easy to read.
But the random; psychedelic-seeming thought trains were way too artsy for me; and the periodic sophomoric vulgarity struck me as stupid (sorry). I did not titter for an instant. There was definitely a plot to follow; but like from the thick main trunk of a vine; there were tendrils of offshoots that obscured the main body at times. Some of these shoots were their own little stories; but some were just weedy backdrop. I'm all for setting a mood or seeing a theme evinced in different ways; although here; I just did not care about any of it.
I did have empathy with Lincoln and his boy; but this story robbed me even of that. Others have complimented the depth of research that went into the accounts; primarily at the front end of the story; but using two books and Google can cough up many quotes and accounts; and for me (who is a boring and methodical scientist); quantity does not equal quality. As a reader; some of them were entertaining (like opposing descriptions of the moon's phase; Lincoln's appearance; etc); but a handful would have sufficed. Thankfully; these barrels full of quotations took up more space such that I did not have to spend too much reading time in the bardo.
Oops. I've gone too far perhaps and ticked my five- and four-star friends off. But I'm not the ""magical realism"" type. Dull; grounded; and bound with facts; this story just isn't my thing. I do love Yann Martel's work and that of Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez; though. Heck; I even adore reading The Master and Margarita every few years around Easter! Talk about the surreal! But this story went too far for me without a meaningful payoff. My 13 year old sister died pretty suddenly - within a week's time - many years ago; and maybe the deterioration of dead 11-year-old Willie speaking from the half-life added to my distaste. I felt a bit protective of and angry on behalf of President Lincoln; too. He was a real person - a heartbroken dad with a helluva stressful job. How dare we pull his memory and that of his little boy out and sandwich it with these absurd ghosts; ones with giant phalluses and multiple noses; just for our entertainment? Shall we next exhume Martin Luther King?
The recurring matterlightblooming phenomena and Mr Bevins' ever growing number of appendages were just too ridiculous for my taste. If Edward Scissorhands or the Mad Hatter or Beetle Juice thrilled you; be my guest - you'll love this. I just do not have an active enough imagination to have taken the plunge into the bardo.
Despite the constellations of five stars out there; this thing went dim for me at the halfway point. . I'd have to have eaten some sort of magic mushroom to have liked this...just not my taste. (less)",523,NEXTBOOK

This is the most unusual; incredible reading experience I have ever had. George Saunders is either a genius; or an other-worldly creature living among us and posing as an author.
I will leave the book description to Goodreads and the book jacket. I will only say this: if you enter this world and let yourself be carried along; you will emerge a different reader at the end. Some of you may not be able to do this; some of you may not wish to accept what is presented; but those who continue will be rewarded with a better understanding of what it means to be a living; loving human being in this imperfect world.
As I was reading I was thinking that there was no way I could follow this story on an audio book; but others reviews have convinced me that listening to this one adds another dimension to this novel. I intend to download it from my library when available; and will add to my review at that time.
I will go out on a limb right now and predict a Pulitzer for George Saunders. And a National Book Award. Deservedly so.
ADDITION: March 12th; 2017
I downloaded this book on audio from my library 4 weeks after reading the print version. I am not a fan of audio books as a rule; I get impatient with the narrators and lose focus because my mind wanders as I'm listening. But after hearing all the praise for the audio; I decided to give it a chance. It proved to be just as incredible. This was more of a performance than anything else; with a different narrator for each voice; and real emotion behind the words. I used earphones and closed my eyes; and entered the graveyard again.
I could actually see the action; and some things I had missed the first time around were made clearer to me this time. It also helped that it is only 7 1/2 hours; so the time investment wasn't that great. Recommended in both forms; but I am glad I read the print version first. (less)",524,NEXTBOOK

The way a moistness in the eye will blur a field of stars; the sore place on the shoulder a resting toboggan makes; writing one's beloved's name upon a frosted window with a gloved finger.
Tying a shoe; tying a knot on a package; a mouth on yours; a hand on yours; the ending of the day; the beginning of the day; the feeling that there will always be a day ahead.
Goodbye; I must now say goodbye to all of it.
George Saunders has written a magnificent; unique; experimental work that is both heartbreaking and humourous; both heavenly and in the mire. This novel examines death and existence thereafter; while exalting the beauty of life; each precious moment of it. It reveals the unbearable grief felt at the loss of a child. It shows; in a chorus of voices; the many hues memory paints of an event. All the while; it magnifies the undeniable dignity of Abraham Lincoln.
The range of this book is astonishing. The format is original - part historical accounting; part Shakespearean play. The concept is this: Willie Lincoln; at 11 years old; dies; breaking his presidential father's heart. He finds himself (amongst a host of other spirits) in the ""Bardo"" (essentially purgatory); where he is visited by his father; and where he decides he will stay in order to see him again. The rest of the story is ghostly; Godly; mystical; mysterious; and oh-so-human. I loved it.
Note: I started this book on audio; but found that due to the sheer number of characters and the unusual format; I was getting lost on key plot points. I decided to read it in print form; which was a wonderful experience. Now I'm listening to the audio and am entranced by it. Now that I'm familiar with the plot; it is fabulous; particularly Nick Offerman who can be funny but also incredibly poignant. (less)",525,NEXTBOOK

I was lucky to receive a review copy of the audiobook from the publisher; because I think this is the preferred format for the novel.
Since George Saunders wrote the novel in 108 sections; with distinct voices; they decided to use 166 voices in the recording (Time Magazine did a short profile of the upcoming production; and you can listen to an excerpt on the publisher site.)
Nick Offerman and David Sedaris; along with George Saunders; are three primary voices (although I thought Sedaris was Holly Hunter until after I'd finished; despite having heard him narrate his own books) and a cast of friends; stars; and family fill out the rest. Some voices are heard only one time; reading a letter or fact from what sounds like real sources; and I imagine some are; some aren't. That is a bit confusing in the beginning; until you get into the rhythm of the novel. It's enough to know that you don't need to remember the voices in conjunction with their names; so they can pass through your mind.
Some of the time the multiple voices seem to just be providing context; but often they are playing with the narrative of context; some remembering a full moon; others remembering a cloudy night; others remembering a crescent; etc. These tiny excerpts are often followed by the narrator with an abbreviation I had not heard; so here's a hint: ""Op. cit."" refers to a longer bibliography or a previously mentioned citation. I wish they had left that out of the audio because I had no idea what it was for most of my listening experience. I had looked up opsit; opsid; oppsid; upsid; and every other combination until I found it. It's a minor thing but gets used so frequently with all the tiny bits; that it drove me to distraction!
Overall the novel is pretty fragmented; and I found I did better in comprehending it when listening for long spans of time; like the five hours I spent in the car yesterday. I am not sure what kind of novel I expected Saunders to write for his first published longer work; but I did not expect something quite so simultaneously historical and experimental!
The highlight for me has to be Nick Offerman though. He is an excellent narrator and now I want to go back and listen to more of his productions. More; please!

- George Saunders; Lincoln in the Bardo
Again; I find myself wandering at night alone; reading grief literature. I'm not sure if I have just accidentally stumbled on my own special vein of grief literature or if this dark path has suddenly become more popular (""to hell with erotic fiction; let us read tales of the sad survivors""). But; here I am; writing another transuding review of another sad book. No. Not sad. Certainly; it deals with sadness. Death and sadness. Certainly. But it is hard to contain Saunders. His stories were never easily boxed; labeled; or restrained. They seemed to crawl under doors; slip through walls; escape the clutches of easy definition. This novel; his first; is also hard to easily categorize. It is historical fiction in that its primary characters (Abraham Lincoln and his dead son William) are historical. But the rest of the characters (and there is an army of characters) are mostly fictional or fictionalized. The book is also historical in the sense that Saunders uses; in an unusual way; historical writings about Lincoln as almost a Greek chorus. There are chapters where a repetition of historical voices; like a series of paintings by Giorgio Morandi (where he paints the same few household objects in slightly different constellations) creates one image out of many eyes. All of these studies; given at different times seem to not confuse the subject but illuminate the subject. So when; in this book; Lincoln's eyes are described by different historical voices as:
""His eyes dark grey; clear; very expressive; and varying with every mood""
- Arnold; The Life of Abraham Lincoln
""His eyes were bright; keen; and a luminous grey color.""
- Ostendorf; Lincoln's Photographs - A Complete Album
""Grey-brown eyes sunken under thick eyebrows; and as though encircled by deep and dark wrinkles.""
- Marquis de Chambrun; ""Personal Recollections of Mr. Lincoln""
""His eyes were a bluish-brown.""
- Wilson & Davis; Herndon's Informants: Letters; Interviews; and Statements about Abraham Lincoln
""The saddest eyes of any human being that I have ever seen.""
Shenk; Lincoln's Melancholy: How Depression Challenged a President and Fueled His Greatness
we get a moving picture. Many pictures; flickering; on-after-another form a living; moving portrait of the MAN.
This technique of borrowing the same description of Lincoln or of an event of Lincoln's life and telling it again and again becomes almost a mantra that pushes the reader back into reality. Shows the reader how things exist in a multitude of ways. How reality might be ALL the experiences of a person; past; present and future and seen by everyone. It also seduces the reader and lulls the reader into a laconic; dream-like state as the strangeness of the novels swirls around. These chapters become an incantation; a rite; a ritual; a dirge.
One of the small gems I loved from this novel is one that won't mean much to anyone else but me. One of the dead slaves; one of the ""Black Beasts""; the ""Damnable savages"" also stuck in purgatory shares my name; or my last name at least. I'm tribal enough that I enjoy that. I like the serendipity of discovering one of the best characters; with one of the best ""voices""; ""the sweetest f____er; but talks so G____ complicated"" has my last name. Perfect. That is the best part of this book; the gist really. That it is IN others and THROUGH others and HELPING others that we discover our own worth. We are saved IN and BY our empathy. As we see the world through slave and soldier's eyes. As we grapple with the suffering of all; the pain of all; we redeem and save each other. Lovely.
The danger with grief literature is it can so; so easily slip into sentimentality. It can quickly slide into sap and pretentiousness. Grief is hard. It is real. It also something; like sex; that is fraught and dangerous to write about. Saunders nails it. He is able to walk THROUGH the valley and WITH the shadows and fear no evil; because tonight; for me; Saunders is the baddest son-of-a-bitch in the bardo (less)",527,NEXTBOOK

The first wakeful moments in the shower usually let you know that any solutions you thought might apply were pure nonsense. Even more often you realize the things you were thinking about werenâ€™t really problems anyway â€“ it was all just anxiety for the hell of it. Anyway; last night I went to bed thinking about what I might say about this celebrated new Saunders book I just read. Even as I was falling asleep; I knew in the light of day this would end up being one of those non-problems. But then I started thinking about a request I got at work to give a presentation about statistical modeling to the 50 or so technologists in our firm. These are clever people â€“ the types who could write episodes of Silicon Valley - so; warily; I began preparing slides in my head that might interest them. As soon as the REM sleep kicked in; I guess I conflated my two goals. I came up with mathematical breakdowns of Lincoln in the Bardo instead. Of course; the first drops of water from the shower should have told me to abandon such thoughts; but I was hard up for an angle as it was; which is a long introduction for what youâ€™re about to see. [Note to self: Donâ€™t mention Goodreads reviews in stats preso.]
I might as well start with the star rating. The input variables in this case; all ranging from 0 (lowest) to 1 (highest) were:
Quality of writing = 0.88
Creativity in structuring = 0.93
Depth of probes into character = 0.48
Exploration of themes = 0.85
Achievement versus expectations = 0.27
Applying equal additive weights to each variable we get:
Rating = 0.88 + 0.93 + 0.48 + 0.85 + 0.27 = 3.41
Iâ€™d read several rave reviews which enticed me. And the premise (Lincolnâ€™s visits to the cemetery after his dear son Willie died at which time and place the transitioning souls there in the bardo encountered him) sounded interesting; too; even if a tad gimmicky. The multiplicity of stories and situations were a chance to place all of humankind on a platter for Lincoln (and us) to ingest. The bardo is a Buddhist concept pertaining to the state of being between death and rebirth â€“ presumably a time of reflection and atonement. As Saunders envisioned it; the cross-section of inhabitants was a wide and noisy one. Still; a more enlightened understanding of one anotherâ€™s ways was possible. Empathy and acceptance were the apparent goals. I give Saunders plenty of credit for highlighting these themes. (I give him even more credit for this commencement speech he gave a few years ago; making a related case for kindness.) My only disappointment was that the individual stories seemed too diffuse and too thin to really permeate.
The book touched briefly on what life must have been like for Lincoln at that point. For someone who was said to be unusually kindhearted and sympathetic to begin with; the grief of Willieâ€™s death along with the weight of the war were almost more than he could bear. Even so; as his countryâ€™s leader he knew he couldnâ€™t wallow. Instead; he had to remind himself of the moral math (though he might not have thought of it in quite those terms) of suffering. His time in the cemetery reminded him that everyone has hardships of some kind at some time; some far worse than others. His job was to make decisions to minimize the cumulative sum of it. So; which is the smaller amount?
Cumulative suffering given war = Î£ Misery[i; t | war] (summed across all individuals i; and future episodes t)
or
Cumulative suffering given no war = Î£ Misery[i; t | no war] (summed across all individuals i; and future episodes t)
The misery of slavery was given a suitably high weight; of course. In fact; Lincolnâ€™s empathy for all was given a representational boost when certain of the souls discovered they could inhabit him and cross-absorb experiences â€“ literally (for purposes of the story) walking a mile in his shoes. A former slave was notably included.
Ancillary mathematical discussion: Certain traits seem to combine additively to produce a given effect. Others are multiplicative. In the example that comes to mind regarding Lincoln (hagiography alert); Iâ€™m positing an exponential relationship.
Power ^ Empathy = Greatness
One of the thornier issues we face as we endeavor to empathize is the amount of dispensation to assign. Itâ€™s easy to say that some higher moral authority has that job; but I still think the old â€œfree will vs. determinismâ€ debate is a good one. Several in the bardo argued that they may have done bad things; but were compelled by their natures and circumstances to do so. Expressing it in an equation; we might get something like this:
Actions and Attitudes = function(Genetics; Brain chemistry; Upbringing; Outside influences like friends or books; Physical needs) + Residual
The residual in this model is the part of our actions and attitudes that cannot be explained by the drivers. Itâ€™s what Iâ€™m imagining free will to be. So the question is; what portion; if any; is to be labeled a choice; superseding what the assigned factors would otherwise dictate? Is that what weâ€™re to be judged by?
I was coached once; when putting together a presentation; to go easy on the equations. Eyes for another half your audience will glaze over for each additional one you include. I guess he was saying:
Remaining interest = Original interest * (0.5 ^ # of equations)
How many of you does that leave? Iâ€™m not even sure I can include myself; having mentally checked out while summing the miseries of those potentially reading this review of a sort. (less)",528,NEXTBOOK

There are brief historical excerpts throughout from various sources that are amazing in that they outline stronger than ever that â€œeye witnessâ€ testimony is pretty much wasted without a camera to back it up. For example; on a historically memorable night 5 or 10 people can look at the same night sky and see no moon at all; or a moon â€“ but in about 5 or 6 different colors and shapes. They can also look at a manâ€™s eyes and see different colors and different expressions. The subjectivity and deception of our senses are brought to life more in this book than any other I have read.
Abraham Lincolnâ€™s young son; Willie; becomes ill and dies. The Lincoln family are devastated by the loss of their 11 year old boy. Unknowingly; President Lincolnâ€™s deep pain of mourning and promises made at his sonâ€™s interment site are anchoring young Willie and preventing him from leaving the state of Bardo and moving on.
In Tibetan Buddhism; Bardo is comprised of several different levels of consciousness that a soul after death ideally moves through to reach the afterlife or next life entry level. There are ways to prepare oneself for these stages while still living; but most souls will have to find their way through the various stages on their own. These stages are recognizable in the various â€œgroundedâ€ souls that Willie comes into contact with. The dialogues here are funny; poignant; and sad â€“ separately and all at once. These souls tell their stories throughout the book â€“ some clearer than others. Sometimes when they get â€stuckâ€™ in their story they receive prompting from others who have heard their stories literally thousands of times before and have them memorized.
The storyline clips back and forth between President Lincoln; the small excerpts from his admirers and detractors; and the various souls in the graveyard; all of them stuck in some level of Bardo that is still attached to earthly concerns.
There are so many aspects of this book that impressed me; and while I couldnâ€™t help but feel the intense sadness of President Lincoln and his family; I was also entertained by the stories and the wide variety of states of consciousness of the souls in Bardo. I actually feel guilty saying that â€“ but some of the exchanges were just plain funny.
This is an impressive book for so many reasons and in the end; I was left with the kind of feeling you get when walking out of a theatre after watching an especially good movie. The bemused smile on the face; the eyes half in this world and half still seeing parts of the movie; the mind at rest yet still processing what it just witnessed. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves that â€œafter-movieâ€ feeling with none of the accompanying partial deafness.

Amidst this background; Lincoln is facing his very own personally traumatic and testing times. After having already lost a son earlier; his gravely ill 11 year old son; Willie; dies and is laid to rest in Georgetown cemetery with a devastated Lincoln visiting. From here; Saunders spins an emotionally powerful; wildly imaginative; heartbreaking but ultimately hopeful tour de force. The bardo is a Tibetan Buddhist term referring to the time period; 'transition'; between death and rebirth; with time spent there determined by the kind of life lived and the nature of the death. Willie is in his bardo; where nothing will ever be the same again; trapped there by the love of his father.
The echo of Lincoln's deluge of suffering is writ large amongst the bereavement and grief of a nation at war. In the bardo; a cacophony and confusion of narrators; the ghosts of the dead; a myriad of voices; have their own stories to impart; chaotic; anarchic; and harmonic. Lincoln does not have the luxury of drowning in a sea of black at the loss of his precious Willie; and despite being riddled by doubts and guilt; the country needs him at the helm in these troubling times. Saunders gives us a wonderfully inspiring; lyrical; humorous; witty and offbeat read; which to be honest I found rather hard to read on occasion; but never less than moving; on the fundamental themes of life and death. Simply extraordinary and highly recommended. Many thanks to Bloomsbury for an ARC. (less)",530,NEXTBOOK

The fundamental problem with modern art is that everything has been done before. Writers; painters and musicians have to concoct something extraordinarily different to be new.
And George Saunders has done exactly that. There has never been a book quite like this before and thatâ€™s why it won the Man Booker Prize 2017. The judges for the last few years have been weighing literary originality over literary quality in my opinion.
In 1917 artist Marcel Duchamp placed an upside down urinal in a gallery and labelled it art. He called it the Fountain. Such a thing was a gesture of irony and a way of arguing against the established ideas of what art can be. Itâ€™s a monumental event in art history and it also echoes what writers such as Joyce; Woolf and T.S Eliot were trying in the literary world with their experimentation. My point is: do you consider a urinal a piece of art?
Whilst Lincoln in the Bardo is not quite a urinal; it firmly establishes that newness does not always mean greatness.
Just because something is new it does not necessarily mean it is entertaining to read or accessible for the reading public. I suppose this is the difference between high-brow and low-brow books. Critically speaking; Saunders has written something rather special here; though is it actually enjoyable?
I liked parts of it. I like the way he played with language and structure. It was very good at evoking pain; though it was simply too long. I donâ€™t consider Lincoln in the Bardo a bad book; though I do consider it terribly boring and repetitive. For me; I felt like I read the entire book after one hundred pages. I gained very little by continuing through to the end. No real momentum was gained and it seemed to loop in on itself with its disjointedness. I felt like Iâ€™d experienced it all very early on and the rest was just wasted words and time.
Not a book I recommend. I think it tried to hard to be different. (less)",531,NEXTBOOK

My father. They will come shortly. To collect meâ€™â€™
Death is a cruel; cynical visitor. Sometimes invited; others unexpected; many more anticipated. Death is blind to age; race; religion; kindness or evilness. He does not discriminate; he takes everyone. He is the one certain thing in the life of every living creature. An unavoidable; unquestionable snatcher. However; donâ€™t we all desire to know what happens next? Perhaps; this is what makes us so afraid; the fear of being lost forever. Whatever it may await; I hope it will be better than the Bardo. A state where souls that havenâ€™t been set free linger; awaiting the next spirit to join their nightmarish Chorus. The Limbo; devoid of everything. A place visited by no God; no Devil. A battlefield; a community whose agony and frustration mirrors the society of the living.
This is where Willie; Abraham Lincolnâ€™s son; finds himself shortly after he dies of a visceral fever. It is said that the great President would visit his child for many days; holding him and thus chaining him to a state where Willie cannot move on; keeping his soul in captivity. Saunders creates this monumental; extraordinary work around this incident and through Lincolnâ€™s devastation; Willieâ€™s uncertainty and confusion and the despair of all the trapped souls that become our guides in this horrifying journey; he weaves a tale of death; love and remembrance. I wonâ€™t comment on this experimental style; the theatrical format and the extraordinary ability to create a unique language for each narrator. For me; these elements arenâ€™t important. What is important is the wealth of themes and issues that make the novel one of the most bizarre and fascinating experiences in the life of the reader.
â€â€™Many guests especially recalled the beautiful moon that shone that evening.â€™â€™
If I had to choose the one thing that made this novel so powerful; it would have to be the crystal clear way in which Saunders depicts the human soul in its kindest and worst aspects. This was obvious in the various views on Abraham Lincoln expressed by the spirits and by the extracts of the press in the era of the Civil War. Demons who desired to keep people chained because they had a different skin colour regarded him as a murderer who dragged their precious sons to war. But they said nothing of the dead sons of their â€â€™propertyâ€™â€™; the raped women; the absolute loss of any trace of human dignity they inflicted on others in their bloody plantations. As we travel through the Bardo; in the chapters that describe the various stages of Willieâ€™s wandering; we see a nation divided by conflicting aspirations and expectations. We see the souls of criminals; prostitutes; noble born people who have come to realize that Death isnâ€™t particularly dazzled by wealth and status. Their pain; despair and struggle for acceptance echo the universe of the living. The two realms are hardly different and while the pitiful ghosts battle with themselves to retain some sort of human identity; they also battle with each other because old habits die hard; if at all. In most of the characters; the difference to their breathing counterparts is little; they hardly regret their faults; all too eager to put the blame on someone else and lure Willie into their cold company.
Saunders writes a sublime elegy of the tremendous; frightening impact of a childâ€™s death on the surviving family. It is a tragedy beyond words; a catastrophe that we donâ€™t even dare to picture in our minds. The grief of good President Abraham is devastating to read; the pain of Mrs Lincoln tears through the soul. Girls that didnâ€™t have the chance to live their love; young men who died on the battlefield; a priest who tried to fulfill his mission as best as he could; a young woman who was raped repeatedly by her master. There is so much pain and yet; the message never becomes dark or pessimistic. Even in the most brutal moments; a glimpse of hope shines through to remind us that; perhaps; if we really try to come together; to respect each other; a better world might become possible. This was Lincolnâ€™s vision; a vision that has been viciously massacred by the majority of the presidents who have occupied the White House in recent Historyâ€¦.Not to mention the state the world has found itself todayâ€¦
Many things have been said about Lincoln In The Bardo. Some may consider it verbose; pretentious; illogical. That is understandable. Not every book is for every reader. For me; this is one of the very finest moments in Literature. Not because it won the Man Booker Prize. Many winners have come and gone and I found them mediocre; forgettable. Not because of the experimental style. Many books have served this technique well; many more will do so in the future. Technicalities donâ€™t matter. It is a masterpiece because it pays homage to the struggles and seemingly futile causes that helped made this Creation a more tolerable place to inhabit. It is a masterpiece because it is written by an author who dived deep into the human soul; found the finest and the worst in all of us and created a tale that is ferocious; sad; haunting; generous; hopeful; tender and fragile. Itâ€™s not an easy read but who wants an easy read; anyway?
â€â€™If I could confer with him; I know he would approve; would tell me it is right that I should go; and come back no more. He was such a noble spirit. His heart loved goodness most.â€™â€™

It begins as a series of quotes from reportersâ€™ notebooks; eyewitness accounts; historians using original sources; and we must assume; Civil War-era gossip rags; describing an 1862 White House party which a thousand or more people attended. To say the affair was elaborate understates the case. Apparently when a thousand hungry guests descended on the tables of food; the quantity was such that it looked untouched after the assault.
Some of the reports mention that this lavish dinner party was going on during the war between the states (1862); and while Lincolnâ€™s favorite son; Willie; lay dying upstairs; probably of typhoid. Some accounts criticize rather than report. Some are clearly inaccurate: â€œThere was a large moonâ€; or â€œthere was no moon.â€ Surely there can be no argument about these truths; one of the accounts must be untrue.
As the novel progresses; it changes form. The reportage becomes a chorus; as voices of the bardoâ€”that state of existence between death and rebirthâ€”declaim and consider the suffering of Lincoln as he contemplates his sonâ€™s death. Father and son (whoâ€™d been but a child!) had been intimates; together at every opportunity; heads often canted towards one another in deep conversation. The voices of the bardo are bawdy; rowdy; yet weirdly profound in their discussion of how fleeting life and how final death and what we learn in the course of a life and what we learn only when weâ€™ve lost it all.
A bardo implies rebirth; but these characters appear to be looking only to escape everlasting nothingness; and enjoy discussing and dissecting the lives of others. Occasionally one of the dead will enjoy a peek at their future (best) selves; which they hadnâ€™t the time or the opportunity to attain. It can be quite moving as each considers his or her life. And here; amidst the humor and tragedy and regret and outright joyâ€”the stuff of lifeâ€”resides the talent of George Saunders; as he tries to reach his best self; whether in love; work; or understanding.
Itâ€™s difficult to believe this is Saundersâ€™ first published novel; and yet that is its designation. It doesnâ€™t even seem like a novel; but immediately brings to mind a radio show; something meant to be spoken aloud; in its many and varied voices. The thread of the novel is not difficult to follow like some avant-garde works; though one may wonder if Lincolnâ€™s sorrow at the death of Willie is all Saunders meant to convey. I think not.
I think there is another step that Saunders wants us to take: that the spirits of the bardo (how it begins to sound like bordello; the more we know of it!) influenced Lincoln when his son died; giving him insight; empathy; and the strength to carry on with his responsibilities; and to bear his personal sorrow; but also the sorrows of a nation at war. We have yet to meet the man who could have stood it alone.
""His mind was freshly inclined toward sorrow; toward the fact that the world was full of sorrow; that everyone labored under some burden of sorrow; that all were suffering; that whatever way one took in this world; one must try to remember that all were suffering (none content; all wronged; neglected; overlooked; misunderstood); and therefore one must do what one could to lighten the load of those with whom one came into contactâ€¦We must try to see one another in this wayâ€¦As suffering; limited beingsâ€¦Perennially outmatched by circumstance; inadequately endowed with compensatory gracesâ€¦And yetâ€¦Our grief must be defeated; it must not become our master; and make us ineffectiveâ€¦We must; to do the maximum good; bring the thing to its swiftest halt andâ€¦Kill more efficientlyâ€¦Must end suffering by causing more sufferingâ€¦His heart dropped at the thought of the killingâ€¦""
So; we must fight; if fighting is required; to defeat wherever oppression exists. We must work together; and weâ€™ll need all the help we can get from those who have glimpsed truth; and the value of kindness.
In a radio podcast with David Remnick; editor of The New Yorker; Saunders tells us that in his research he discovers that Lincoln could have negotiated an end to the war in 1862 when the casualty levels were terrifically high. He must have wanted to end the slaughter so desperately; but one requirement of the agreement would have been to return the slaves to the South; and Lincoln simply refused. The black people who make an appearance in this novel live cruelly unfair and insecure lives.
One could make the case that a novel of this kind is not unprecedented. Think of the ancient Greeks with their choruses of wise and not-so-wise men; Italyâ€™s Dante with his examination of the good or bad we do in life affecting our placement in the afterlife; Englandâ€™s Shakespeare with his oft-found articulate spirits remarking on the action; Irelandâ€™s Beckett (and his influence Joyce) for language and the insight wrapped in foolishness; Americaâ€™s Barth and Mamet for exactitude and a deep; abiding humor when rationality might suggest despair.
The rich variety of voices in this novel are captured in the audio production of this book. In an interview published in time.com; Saunders explains how the Penguin Random House team worked with him (kudos; everyone) to get the requisite 166 voices; including famous stage and screen actors like David Sedaris; Ben Stiller; Lena Dunham; among others; to speak the parts so that it sounds like the â€œAmerican choraleâ€ Saunders was trying to convey.
At the same time; I found it helpful to have a written text to clarify Saundersâ€™ experimental form which uses footnotes interspersed with conversation among ghosts. I adored what Saunders was able to tell us from his advanced age of 58 yearsâ€”the stuff about not doing anything you canâ€™t adequately explain to heavenâ€™s gatekeepers; and how â€œit wasnâ€™t my faultâ€ actually isnâ€™t much of a defense when one has been lingering in the afterworld for more than fifty years; unable to convince even a bleeding-heart saint that one wasnâ€™t a douche that time.

George Saunders' brilliant literary achievement is the ideal book for the Fourth of July in profoundly reminding us of our union as citizens of the United States of America; this great nation created by our forefathers' Declaration of Independence from the ""absolute Despotism;"" ""long train of abuses and usurpations"" and ""invasions on the rights of the people"" by the then ""King of Great Britain;"" our democracy founded upon principles of equality and each individual's endowment ""by [our] Creator with certain unalienable rights; [such as] Life; Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" And; it provides just as important a remembrance of how our country was nearly crushed; but ultimately was forged; by the crucible of a civil war that cost the lives of over 620;000 young men (in perspective; a number that today would proportionally be roughly six and a half million).
More significant than these; through a fictional rendering of our President Abraham Lincoln's loss of his 11-year-old son Willie; the novel elegantly recalls our connectedness; despite our many differences; through our shared human experience of love; family and the anguished grief we each suffer in losing those we love.
In February 1862; close to a year after President Lincoln's inauguration and ten months after the start of the Civil War; he lost his son Willie to typhoid fever. Author George Saunders; primarily known for his satirical short stories; speculates that President Lincoln's revival in the face of a human being's greatest loss--of his child--prepared him especially to pull the nation through the jaws of darkness and the legion losses suffered by families on both sides of the Civil War.
Saunders crafts three vibrant; compelling characters from differing backgrounds to drive the novel's narrative in Georgetown's Oak Hill cemetery; in the ""bardo"" (Tibetan for limbo between the world and the eternal afterlife). Hans Vollman is a charmingly gruff printer who carries about in a tumescent state [existing as he died; just prior to consummating his marriage to a wife twenty years his junior]; Roger Bevins; an Orphean suicide with a bounty of extra eyes; hands; ears; noses that pop out when he becomes agitated or excited; and; Reverend Everly Thomas; a sage man of the cloth whose mouth is cast permanently in an ""O"" of fright.
This trio is joined by a host of other colorful characters as they chaperone young Willie; left behind in the bardo instead of ascending because he wanted to see his dad once more.
Saunders seamlessly intersperses the novel's rich and intellectually stimulating dialogue with brief chapters containing excerpts from news accounts; memoirs; diaries and biographies of the time; which display the harsh tenor of the public outcry in the months after Lincoln assumed the presidency; when he had no clear plan for resolving the nascent war or the conflicts leading to the southern states' secessions; including: ""The Presdt is an idiot;"" George B. McClellan; ""Vain; weak; puerile; hypocritical... By all odds; the weakest man who has ever been elected;"" Sherrard Clemens; and; ""Will go down to posterity as the man who could not ... understand the circumstances and interests of his country... who plunged his country into a great war without a plan; who failed without excuse; and fell without a friend;"" London Morning Post.
The novel largely enamors with its punchy tone containing humor to prompt a few laughs loud enough to wake the family. The narrative tightens for a short stretch when departed slaves from outside the segregated cemetery travel to Oak Hill to see the President; only to be met by resistance from a violent; racist faction led by a bombastic Confederate officer.
I cannot recall a novel so manifesting that which unites us as a country and as human beings: ""At the core of each lay suffering; our eventual end; the many losses we must experience on the way to that end."" At the same time; the novel inspires in its portrayal of the human spirit's resilience and perseverance. Abraham Lincoln; generally acknowledged as the country's greatest president; who had been ""broken; awed; humbled; diminished"" by his son's death and roundly ridiculed as ""a person of very inferior cast of character; wholly unequal to the crisis;"" rises from the ruins to remake himself and hold together a nation seemingly torn asunder.
The bardo's voices range widely from farmers and soldiers to priests and suicides; as emblematic of the diversity of opinions and backgrounds of our country's departed in 1861. Saunders writes each tone as valued and like he's conducting a symphony; with the result being a sort of cosmic chorus in ""cordial unison""* under brocades of blue; twinkling white willows and a rain of red glare; celebrating the human spirit and similarities that can unite our nation.
By novel's end; the President's final goodbye to the body of his son can leave one undone; for others; the trio's farewell aria might do just as well; by lacing the reader with the unalloyed beauty of simple things in life that we take for granted as if our days here are limitless. Bevins; the young erudite poet; captures it best as he contemplates leaving the world behind: ""the things of the world were strong with me still...such as... cold water from a tin jug; toweling off one's clinging shirt post-June rain... Pearls; rags; buttons... The way a moistness in the eye will blur a field of stars... writing one's beloved's name upon a frosted window with a gloved finger...""
It is no stretch to predict that time will bestow this novel with the status of a ""modern classic;"" one that is studied in literature classes when your children's children attend grade school. ""Lincoln in the Bardo"" represents a memorial to those who have gone before us; a tribute to President Abraham Lincoln; and a celebration of Americans' spirit to rise from defeats and our resolve to endure and succeed.
*Thomas Paine used the phrase ""cordial unison"" in his 1791 ""Rights of Man"" to describe the United States' form of government as putting a premium on equality and the unalienable rights of all. [Unfortunately; it wasn't until over a century later that anyone but white men were provided any (or most) of these rights]. (less)",534,NEXTBOOK

Thatâ€™s a determination I like to put off until rereading. But this novelâ€™s certainly masterful. I have read nothing so near perfect in some years. The narrative rides a kind of knife edge; between unbearable sorrow one moment and comic relief the next.
â€Almost unbearably movingâ€™ was what Anthony Burgess used to say about some of the better books he reviewed. I must say the same with regard to Lincoln in the Bardoâ€”itâ€™s almost unbearably moving. Itâ€™s about unendurable personal loss and grief suffered by President Abraham Lincoln when his son; Willie; died at age 11. Much of Abeâ€™s grief is a matter of personal record; discussed in many histories and memoirs of the day. The novel is rendered in part in a cut-and-paste style reminiscent of William Burroughs; though tonally it has nothing to do with his work. I do not mean to deprecate the technique; for in the pastiche sections the effect is brilliant; given that these have been assembled entirely from the works of others.
The fictional sections; however; in the Bardo; are entirely products of the authorâ€™s imagination. The setting is Oak Hill Cemetery; in Georgetown; Washington D.C. Aside from the occasional living funeral party; itâ€™s almost entirely occupied by the spirits of the dead; spooks: people buried there whose existences in this interstitial realmâ€”before rebirth; according to certain schools of Tibetan Buddhismâ€”are beset by karmic reckonings in the form of a host of phantasmagorical torments. So there is their unendurable personal loss and grief; too. Their suffering is the obverse of Abeâ€™s. In terms of sheer emotional impact the novelâ€™s part Danteâ€™s Inferno and part Juan Rulfo's Pedro PÃ¡ramo. A deeply satisfying novel. (less)",535,NEXTBOOK

But how to review this book? It renders me speechless and. I almost feel compelled to reduce my review to two words: â€œRead it.â€
Years ago; I learned; while visiting the Lincoln Museum in Springfield; Illinois; that Abraham Lincoln was so prostrated by grief after the death of his favorite son Willie that he visited the crypt for months afterwards; opening the coffin and stroking the face and hair of his deceased son. Itâ€™s a macabre image but one that is sears at the very heart of anyone who has lost a loved one.
This image is the seed from which Lincoln in the Bardo sprouts. The Bardo; in Tibetian Buddhism; is a sort of limbo state between death and rebirth into the next life. Willie lingers in that state; unable to move forward; while his father languishes in his own bardo: needing to take the helm and steer the country forward while feeling near paralyzed by his despondency.
The book is peopled by ghosts except for three of the living: the president; the night watchman; and a woman in a home across from the graveyard. Using a Greek chorus approach; many characters speak in turn â€“ Willie and many of his fellow deceased who cannot move on and two of the three living characters. We never hear Abraham Lincolnâ€™s own voice.
Even more remarkably; the book not only intertwines and living and the dead; it also intertweaves history. There are direct quotes from the time (all annotated) as well as fictional quotes from the time (also â€œannotatedâ€) and then there are the voices. Only the most precise historian would be able to decipher what is real and what is invented.
Yet it almost doesnâ€™t matter because the book is not just â€“ or even primarily -- about Abraham and Willie. It is about Every Man. And here is where it becomes remarkable. As the chorus reminds us: â€œThough on the surface it seemed every person was different; this was not true. At the core of each lay suffering; our eventual end; the many losses we must experience on the way to that end. We must try to see each other in this way. As suffering; limited beingsâ€”Perennially outmatched by circumstance; inadequately endowed with compensatory graces.â€
George Saunders; in soaring and lyrical prose that sometimes approaches poetry; advances the theme that whatever happens to us after we die; it wonâ€™t be entirely unconnected to what we are while living. By the end of the novel; I was convinced that this was not a death story. Itâ€™s a love story â€“ a love story for humanity and all that interconnects us.
One of the characters says; â€œOne must be constantly looking for opportunities to tell oneâ€™s story.â€ To understand our own story and to have the understanding and grace to tell it is truly what matters. This may be one of my favorite contemporary books ever.

matthew
We got no problem with the book; we just got issue with you trying to play it off like you read the goddamned thing.
mr.mcdowell
I agree that misrepresentation of your consumption of the novel would lead others astray. Though there has been some data to suggest that reading and listening to an audiobook provide the same experience and value.
mr. quann
While I might concede that the quotidian audiobook adaptation might provide the same benefits as that of the paper copy; Lincoln in the Bardo is no such commonplace aural production.
matthew
Indeed; Matthew brings up a salient point. This is not what you would expect from most audiobooks.
mr. quann
Enough with the goddamned ten-dollar bullshit words. The people donâ€™t want to read no review of a book that makes them pick up another goddamned book to figure out whatâ€™s being said. Let me tell it to you like it is.
mr. mcdowell
By all means.
mr. quann
And so it begins again.
matthew
Ya see; thereâ€™s a lot of goddamned people in this book. All ghosts; or mostly; itâ€™s pretty goddamned confusing from the get-go and I suggested getting the hell outta the way of something so shitting confusing; grabbing a couple beers and sitting back to some goddamned television. But no; no; these chumps wanted to keep on listening having no idea whatâ€™s what for the first hour. This isnâ€™t what itâ€™s like with goddamned television. Nothing like the television to get you one man kicking another man; or punching another in the teeth; occasionally a bit of nudityâ€”
mr. mcdowell
To the point; sir.
matthew
Alright; alright. Not a drop a patience to spare between the two of ya. So; thereâ€™s a lot of voices here. 166 different goddamned voices; and each one of them gets to say a little something. They do a good job too; these voices. Iâ€™ll give â€em that much.
mr. mcdowell
What Mr. McDowell is trying to convey is that the diverse and star-studded cast does a very stunning performance of a book filled with emotional range.
mr. quann
Precisely. And should I tell 'em about the tower?
mr. mcdowell
If youâ€™ll; perhaps; permit me?
matthew
Yeah; yeah.
mr. mcdowell
Coming into the world the esteemed Mr. Saunders has crafted is indeed disorienting; but can one truly expect anything other than disorientation from the period after death? The flurry of voices; each telling their own tale of misery; woe; regret; desperation; joy; and so forth can make for confusion. But then; as we listened; the voices began to; well
matthew
Began to coalesce at the same time as they began to differentiate.
mr. quann
And right there in shitting front of me.
mr. mcdowell
Formed in our mindsâ€™ eye.
mr. quann
Stood a tower of mouths arrayed beside and stacked on top of one another like bricks; each one speaking in turn and
matthew
Having some good goddamned conversation.
mr. mcdowell
Itâ€™s surreal structure reflecting the peculiar; surreal imagery of Lincoln in the Bardo. A tower that might stand alongside Mr. Vollmanâ€™s perpetually engorged appendage and be known to have come from the same place.
mr. quann
These voices forming a cacophony that drew me away from lifeâ€™s daily trials during my sojourns to and from my work in the hospital. Formingâ€”
matthew
Forming a goddamned great novel.
mr. mcdowell
Forming a tale of such impressive structure; wonder; surprising humour; and depth of emotion that itâ€™s very description defies the abilities of this humble trio.
mr. quann
I hope you will permit me the suggestion that it is the finest audiobook that I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. Indeed; I would go so far as to say that it would be a distinct pleasure to be able to listen to the esteemed Mr. Saundersâ€™ writing again. Or; perhapsâ€”
matthew
Or perhaps read the goddamned thing instead of listening to the goddamned thing?
mr.mcdowell
Though I doubt heâ€™d put it in such words; I canâ€™t help but think that is what he means.
mr. quann
Yes; thatâ€™s quite right; and your clarification of Mr. McDowellâ€™s most crude nature is appreciated by myself and; no doubt; the audience.
matthew
It is both a pleasure and my duty.
mr. quann
Indeed; I could easily see myself reading the novel if only to experience it in another form.
matthew
Alright; enough of all this; itâ€™s time to bring this goddamned experiment to itâ€™s righteous goddamned end.
mr.mcdowell
But Mr. McDowell! We havenâ€™t even begun to discuss the characters; the resonance of the tale with the modern era; the universality of its themes; the diversity of experience represented withinâ€”
matthew
the civil war as backdrop; the imaginative and playful imagery; the stunning writing; the inclusion of historical documents; the fantastical coexisting with the real andâ€”indeedâ€” how the real and the fantastical serve to elevate one another and
mr. quann
and we have not even begun to discuss the story or the inclusion of Willie Lincoln orâ€”
matthew
None of that shit matters. What; you want to spoil the whole thing for them? You want their goddamned experience just so yous can talk about it? Ain't it enough just to say that it's good?
mr. mcdowell
Mr. Quannâ€™s suggestions; though coarse; are perhaps true.
matthew
Indeed Matthew; I think it best if we leave it to the listeners and readers to decide what to make of the book. We can invite discussion.
mr. quann
We have certainly enjoyed enough discussion of our own that I would not be surprised to find others enjoying the same. I think Mr. McDowell is correct in that we should leave the discovery of the book to the readers themselves.
matthew
Goddamned right.
mr. mcdowell

Its ever-growing tendrils seek out the most tender of hearts. It resides with the weight of its heaviness to such a state that breathing full; cleansing breaths is almost impossible.
""The terror and consternation of the Presidential couple may be imagined by anyone who has ever loved a child; and suffered that dread intimation common to all parents; that Fate may not hold that life in as high a regard; and may dispose of it at will.""
February of 1862 brings with it an end to the life of young Willie; son of Abraham and Mary Lincoln. It is the uncanny realization that death enters through a time-marked door for us all no matter what the station we hold. We exist not one second longer than was intended by our very birth. Mary is wracked with such sorrow that she cannot attend Willie's funeral. Lincoln; himself; makes lingering visitations to view the little body inside of the crypt. And Willie......
Willie hovers in a transitional stage much akin to the Tibetan Buddhist belief of existence between the finality of death and the renewal of a new dimension of life....the bardo. It is within this bardo that George Saunders introduces us to a marching caravan of individuals who will swing your head back and forth in amazement. Death has not become a reality for the majority of them quite yet. We are given brief glimpses into their former lives which may or may not satisfy the hunger to know more and to unveil their uncertain relevance to this story.
Saunders employs the use of appropriate/inappropriate quotes taken from mind-boggling sources of research. The format and presentation is unlike anything that you have ever read before. There is absolute brillance within these pages with finite descriptions of sorrow and the human condition. At the same time; there is the wafting scent of confusion and the tedium of tredding down paths that seem to serve no purpose or a purpose clutched tightly in the hand of this talented author with the realization that there will be broad interpretation by each reader. And that; dear readers; will wet your whistle.....or not.
But the one seemingly evident thread of this story is simply the profound sense of loss. George Saunders brings you into the crypt aside of Lincoln and with it is the reminder of your own crypts in life. Lincoln suffers through the personal loss of his own son and this country's loss of son after son through the Civil War with the body count in the millions. Deep; deep sorrow painted dark; endless furrows in Lincoln's heart and soul. I will leave you with George Saunders' own words that still dance in my mind.
""What I mean to say is; we had been considerable. Had been loved. Not lonely; not lost; not freakish; but wise; each in his or her own way. Our departures caused pain. Those who loved us sat upon beds; heads in hand; lowered faces to tabletops; making animal noises. We had been loved; I say; and remembering us; even many years later; people would smile; briefly gladdened at the memory."" (less)",538,NEXTBOOK

I think it is what you would have to describe as a reading experience since it is told in multiple voices aided by constant footnotes attributing the text to its sources. So clever! And so much research. The author must have become a real expert on Abraham Lincoln by the time he finished writing.
Amazingly the whole fascinating book takes place over one night immediately after Lincoln's young son's funeral. Lincoln makes a last visit to his son and here the book takes a turn into the supernatural and the reader meets a host of people who reside in the cemetary; not believing they are dead; and therefore not passing over as they should.

Just.... soooo sloooowwww.
Let's be honest; I actually liked Divergent for what it was - a fast-paced; exciting YA adventure that demanded very little of me. Sure; a lot of the world made absolutely no sense; and I still find that whole ""I'm Dauntless so I jump off moving trains"" thing so ridiculously laughable; but I found it really entertaining. In this book; though; I spent the majority of it wondering where the actual plot was.
It's set in space; and I've heard other reviewers talking positively about how it doesn't feel like it's in space; so maybe that will also seem like a positive for you; but I felt like this story could have been set literally anywhere. The world-building was lacking and the space aspect left undeveloped. Why even bother setting it in space if you're not going to make the most of that? Though I guess there's a definite possibility that the second book will reveal that the characters have actually been in Brooklyn all along; tripping on acid. So; there's that.
The story is set on a distant planet where people develop unique powers known as currentgifts; bestowed by a magical current that runs through the galaxy. Most people find their gifts useful; but to some people - like Akos and Cyra - the gifts can be a burden; and a means by which others can use them for their own gains. Cyra's violent and evil brother is the ruler of the Shotet and he uses Cyra's power - the power to deliver intense pain - to further his plans and torture his enemies.
Akos; on the other hand; is one of the gentle Thuvhe people. Carve the Mark opens with Shotet soldiers murdering Akos's father and capturing him and his younger brother. What happens next is a very long bit of filler about Akos's time in the Shotet soldier camp; honing his fighting skills and chatting with Cyra about their countries; their powers; or just their favourite colours. I was more than halfway through and wondering when something was going to happen.
It wasn't compelling enough. The characters themselves were not interesting enough. If I wasn't wary of the backlash I would get from writing a DNF review; I would have put it aside. The action occasionally picks up but it's not the start of a change of pace; it quickly dies down again. I felt like something happened once every hundred pages.
And it's not so easy to mask the simplicity; the lack of creativity; in Roth's latest work. Divergent had just enough quirks to make it stand out against the odds - the use of factions an exciting reminder of Hogwarts' houses for old Potterheads; and a new personality quiz for younger readers. Even those feeling underwhelmed were quick to take a faction quiz to see where they fell (Candor - thanks for asking!).
What does Carve the Mark have to make it stand out? I honestly don't have an answer.
The world is very simplistic. The Xmen-like powers are nothing we haven't seen before hundreds of times. The politics are uninteresting and the villain is mindlessly evil without any depth or development.
I said in a status update that there had been some confusion over the physical descriptions of the characters - that the violent savages are actually described as ""so pale he looked almost like a corpse"" and the pacifist Thuvhe people have ""light brown skin"" and ""dense; curly hair"" - but the reality is only marginally better than the rumours. Having a violently savage race vs. a gentle race without it being adequately addressed is arguably always problematic; it arguably always has troubling real-world connotations. And; even if you disagree with that assessment; at best it's just plain lazy.
A hard slog and utterly forgettable.

The characters were also completely one dimensional and a bore to read about; so really I couldn't find anything to like about the book.

The UK publisher asked me to review the book; they sent me a contract to sign for me to sign saying that I would get paid. I declined because I don't rate books well to earn a few coins; I'm the Book Bitch for a reason. When I declined the UK publisher then broke all contact with me and we've not had a working relationship since.
Let's talk about the elephant in the room: Sponsered reviews from booktubers who were paid to give a positive review and are completely ignoring the Racist Bullshit in this book. Now most of these Booktubers are ones with influence; aka; Jesse; Kat; Christine; Regan; Sasha - And all of them gave the book a 4 star rating. Which is weird in itself because there's also more Booktubers who signed a contract and gave it that same rating.
My issue is that they're happy enough to not talk about the Racism in the book because they'd rather get paid instead of being honest. You can't trust these people because they honestly don't care how Racism affects POC. If they did then they'd have talked about it in their reviews. Did they? Nope. Jesse added on an edit saying he didn't see the racism which I'm calling bullshit on. He's trying to make himself look better.
Honestly?
I'm fed up of certain Booktubers who are happy enough to ignore serious issues just so they can get paid. At the end of the day if you want money then get a real job instead of making money of dishonest book reviews. (less)",542,NEXTBOOK

i'm going to review this without giving too much away; which seems to be the publisher's desire; since this is the first time i have ever gotten an arc that had this
across every single page.
text blurred so no one yells at me.
DON'T YELL AT ME!
i am someone who liked the divergent trilogy. i even sort of liked those four stories: Four: A Divergent Story Collection.
but i am SO SO pleased that roth has diverged (ho-HO!) from that path and gone off in a whole new direction with this book (which is apparently the first part of a duology). i do love an author with more than one idea in their head.
in a lot of ways; this book is like saga
it's got that same romeo and juliet in spaaaaaaace thing going on; where two people on opposite sides of a long and deeply-rooted cultural animosity develop special feelings for each other after one of them is basically the prisoner of the other.
no wings; no horns; and no teevee-headed people; but the two crazy kids in this book do have some unusual abilities in the form of currentgifts.
currentgifts.
currentgifts.
currentgifts.
currentgifts.
i still think this is a dumb word; but it's a little less dumb than i expected going into it. ""current"" does not mean a ""now"" gift; which is how i interpreted it from the synopsis; but rather to a gift from a magical current that runs through the galaxy; doling out special abilities to people. some of these abilities are useful; and some are more like burdens than gifts. think x-men. in spaaaaaaaace.
i am not usually a fan of space-based novels; and i'm even less enthusiastic about the romantic parts of books; especially in YA. however; i most certainly enjoyed this book. the fact that it is set in space is easy to forget; which sounds like a criticism; but worked out well for me. it's otherworldly; but it's not full of people floating about in spacesuits or going through wormholes or making me feel inadequate in my understanding of; you know; science.
the romance is what it is - it's certainly handled better than the romance in other books i have read (including divergent; now that i think about it). it unfolds slowly; it isn't too sappy; and it is grounded in circumstances that seem likely to inspire feelings of ""you and me against the world;"" where two characters who are treated as ""other"" by most people cleave to each other in their otherness and feelings develop in a way that makes sense.
although maybe not to them:
""You make no sense to me;"" she said.
and happily - cyra is not tris recast in spaaaaaaaace.
there are the superficial physical differences - cyra has darker skin; is much taller and â€¦ sturdier than tris; and by the end of the book; something happens that alters her appearance in a way that i personally think is SO FREAKING COOL; and also ghastly. but more importantly; her personality is not just warming up the tris leftovers. they are both proactive and badass with the fighting skills without getting too sentimental when violence needs doing; but cyra has had a much harder path dealt to her than tris; and it has toughened her worldview; giving her more depth and darkness than tris ever had.
Pity; I knew; was just disrespect wrapped in kindness.
i will confess; it took me some time to get into this one. it may have been my headspace at the time of reading; or it may truly have been a slow starter. divergent grabbed me from the get-go; and i had expected this would be a typically fast YA read for me; but i didn't start really digging it until i was about a third of the way through. some of the drag of it is indeed the names and sillywords; and some of it just doesn't make sense; but a lot of the divergent world didn't make a lick of sense; and it didn't stop it from being entertaining. if books had to make sense; christianity never would have caught on.
oh; and the title?
-""Carve the mark;"" I said; my throat tight.
and
-""Carve the mark;"" he said. He was so hoarse the words almost didn't come out.
what does it mean? why does it make throats tight and words hoarse?
blur blur blur - you'll have to wait for that.

I work for a bookstore and received an ARC of this book through my job. All opinions are my own. This review is not an attack on the author; the publisher; or anyone else. I am also white; and I am aware this affects my position to call something out as racist. I find that it's helpful to raise awareness of problematic representation in the media we consume.
In regards to advance copies being sent out to reviewers; I've noticed in a lot of Goodreads reviews that the bloggers state either at the beginning or the end of their review that HarperTeen (HT from here on out) sponsored these reviews. Further research led me to discovering that HT paid this set of bloggers to review Carve the Mark. This behavior from a publisher is unsettling. Generally speaking; if one is going to be paid for reviewing something; one will not review the thing unfavorably (and if one reviews unfavorably; that reviewer runs the risk of tarnishing the relationship with said publisher). This behavior by the publisher is akin to self-published authors paying readers to post positive reviews of the work in order to boost sales. That's what I feel like HT is doing. Perhaps HT was aware of the problematic material in the book and decided to garner a set of positive reviews to boost sales before the book's official release. I feel as if that money could have been better used to assist Roth in adjusting some of the problematic ideas presented in the book.
I stopped reading at page 66. I was simultaneously bored and unsettled by the book and set it aside. This being said; I do not know how the book ends or develops; and I honestly don't care. Here are the main things I found problematic within those first 66 pages:
1. The Thuve and the Shotet. The Thuve are presented as a lighter skinned race who are passive. Akos; one of the main characters; views the Shotet as a brutal and fierce race of people (the Shotet killed Akos's grandmother). The first time the readers are introduced to the Shotet; the Shotet arrive to Akos's family farm and brutally murder his father.
2. The Shotet language is described as harsh and gutteral by Akos compared to his own softer sounding language (who discovers he has the ability to speak other languages without prior conscious knowledge of them). This view of languages is similar to the comparisons of the ""music"" of Romance (white) languages (French; Italian; Spanish) to the ""harsh; guttural"" (black) languages of the African continent.
3. While the Shotet are described has having varying tones of skin; Cyra's mother is described as having hair curly enough for fingers to be trapped in the curls while Cyra's is not as curly as that. Um. Okay.
4. Cyra's brother Ryz forcibly trades one of his memories for one of Cyra's. Cyra obviously struggles against it and can't fight it; and you know what? That's rape. Forcing someone to take something mentally (and inevitably physically) is an act of rape. Cyra was raped by her own brother. As a result of that rape; Cyra's power manifests itself as pain. Literally. Pain. By page 66; Cyra cannot touch other people without feeling pain; and other people cannot touch her without feeling pain.
5. Later; Cyra's mother asks the doctor ""You're saying this gift is my daughter's fault? That she wants to be this way?"" And the doctor (male) says; ""Cyra; the gift comes from you. If you change; the gift will; too."" So a man is telling a woman that her rape and her pain from that rape is her own fault and that she can change it at will. Yep. That's a blatant reinforcement of rape culture.
6. The religion of the Shotet draws heavily from Islamic ideology. Some of the religious leaders are called clerics; and some of the practices reinforce the negative views the West has on Muslim culture. We need to move past these harmful stereotypes.
7. While I enjoyed the Divergent trilogy well enough for what it is (even if it's a blatant knockoff of The Hunger Games and Harry Potter; it is also somewhat original in its ending); Carve the Mark is a lazy reimagining of the Star Wars and X-Men universes. It tries to be unique and diverse; but the glaring insensitivity within the first sixty pages result in its failing.
I was excited for this because there aren't too many science fiction novels lately for the YA audience. However; the problems in the novel fail its readers by relying on outdated; racist tropes that should be a thing of the past in 2017. Science fiction is about creating new worlds; exploring new ideas; and finding some kernel of society to examine. Carve the Mark does none of this. Instead of drawing on redundant; harmful tropes; science fiction should offer the author and the readers the ability to create something new; to flip tropes and reinvent them. It seems as if the editors failed to notice or didn't care; knowing that they'd have a cash-grab with the popular name attached; or it seems as if Roth is privileged enough to be unaware of the damage she has caused with these themes. Maybe it's a combination of both.
After the roller coaster of the last several years with the Black Lives Matter movement; the systematic oppression of Muslims; and the discussions I have had and read; I'm finding myself more and more sensitive to the plights of those who are oppressed. I want to give those people a voice rather than reinforce harmful views. Instead of purchasing or reading this; I recommend finding; like many others have suggested; an own voices/diverse work. My personal recommendation is N.K. Jemisin's The Fifth Season. (less)",545,NEXTBOOK

Where do I start?????
Racial stereotyping and cultural misappropriations.
Unflagged trigger warnings.
And a romanticised depiction of chronic pain (something that is very personal to me).
But let's begin with the writing. Wow talk about dull! The first half of this book was so incredibly tedious. The pace; the plotting; the world building (what world building?!?!)... It just dragged. It felt uninspired; insipid; unimaginative; take your pick! Was this book set in space??? It didn't feel like that to me. One of the things that I really didn't like with regards to the writing was the format of switching points of view. It just did not work because it was so poorly executed. It seemed much too haphazard and really hindered the flow of the narrative.
So the basic set up is there are two races of people sharing some planet. They hate each other because *reasons* and hatred & drama ensue.
Okay. Controversy number one: Racist undertones
Many people have been incredibly offended by the depiction of the races in this book saying that it reinforces negative stereotypes within our society. There's a seemingly more civilised race versus a more savage one. Personally I found that there was enough nuance with regard to the diversity of the descriptions of the physical appearances of the two races; but; I think this may have been due to my prior knowledge of this controversy because I was actively reading looking for the differences. If you step back from the book; the overall impression of the two races is not so clear. And there were also worrying descriptors used to ascribe differences between characters; e.g. a reference to curly hair tight enough to capture a finger which is reminiscent of the pencil test used during apartheid times in South Africa to ascertain skin colour. An inadvertent unconscious similarity??? At any rate; I think that conceptually this was a bad idea. Because division of race; even in a fantastical setting; is going to cause problems within our own reality. It is going to offend. And surely that isn't the way forward? I also found a lot of ethnic stereotyping going on in this book. Parts of various cultures being borrowed in a less than savoury manner. Basically at times I felt the book was not carefully researched and therefore did not provide a well thought out and sensitively structured system of beliefs for the people in the story.
Trigger Warning Self Harm At this point I would like to draw your attention to some ritualistic behaviours the Shotet people do regarding marking their bodies. In particular during chapter 13 there is a very detailed description of something that could be incredibly triggering to anyone who has issues regarding self-harm. While I personally am okay with the theory behind this behaviour I strongly feel that there should be a warning on the back cover of this book with regards to this behaviour. When are authors and publishers going to take some responsibility for the possible detrimental effects of the content of their published works???
Back to the story:
The three main characters in this book are:
Cyra; a Shotet girl who experiences chronic pain.
Her power hungry; villainous brother Ryzek.
And then there is Akos; a Thuvhesit boy fated to serve his Shotet enemy.
Let's start with Akos.... I've pretty much nothing to say about him. He was about as interesting as a piece of cardboard. Zero personality. One dimensional. Boring...move on!!!
Ryzek; the big bad. Likes to rape minds and steal memories. He could have been a quite chilling character but his portrayal descended into pantomime theatrics and a sensitive subject such as forcibly taking what you want and thereby violation of another person was very badly handled.
Next controversy: Rape Culture
So Ryzek rapes Cyra's mind thus causing the early onset of her 'currentgift' which leaves her experiencing chronic pain for which she is ultimately told is her fault because she feels she deserves this pain... That bother anyone else??? Reinforce the idea of victim shaming/blaming???
And finally; there is Cyra. She's an interesting character. It's a bold move to attempt to write a character suffering from chronic pain... But was it a move that paid off???
Well with regards to the storyline yes!
With regards to upsetting and offending sufferers of chronic pain then it's a big no.
Chronic pain controversy
So here's a little information about me.
Many of my Goodreads friends will know that from time to time I have mentioned that I suffer from multiple chronic illnesses. (Yes multiple.) And one of those illnesses in particular causes great physical pain. It causes more pain than I could ever possibly explain to you. My chronic pain took hold of my life when I was still a child almost 25 years ago. So I think that living with chronic pain for the best part of a quarter of a century qualifies me to discuss it.
My first problem with Cyra's chronic pain is the terminology used. It is frequently described as a 'currentgift'. In the glossary a currentgift is explained as follows: thought to be a result of the current flowing through a person; currentgifts are abilities; unique to each person; that develop during puberty. They are not always benevolent.
Isn't that last line about this currentgift not always being benevolent great??? As if it somehow excuses you from the offensive terminology of calling the suffering of the main character a 'gift'.
Here's a tip for you. Do not ever call chronic pain a gift. Even if it's in a slightly made-up word that you feel the need to explain in the back of your book.
What really annoyed me in this instance is how Cyra referred to her pain as a gift. I could accept anyone else in the book referring to it as such and put it down to their ignorance and then possibly have Cyra show why it should not be called such a thing... But she FREQUENTLY called it a gift without any hint of irony; derision or sense of injustice!!! Only once did she disagree; but then; instead of referring to the pain in some other manner; she continued on with this gift terminology. My pain is not; and will never be a gift. I will always experience pain. There is no out. And I am incredibly offended by even remotely suggesting that it could possibly be construed as a gift. Where is my gift receipt please because I'm sending this unwanted gift back!!!
Also; my chronic pain is not an ability. An ability???? I don't do magic tricks with it. Unless you want to see how easily I can swallow large painkillers with barely a mouthful of water so I don't vomit!!!!!
Okay. I get where the idea of this character is coming from. And there are aspects to the descriptions surrounding Cyra's pain that I really liked.
The pain was just part of life now. Simple tasks took twice as long because I had to pause for breath
Great stuff! The normality of everyday living changes completely when you live with chronic pain. You don't have an off switch from it; you have different levels of intensity and somehow you get through a day. And everything takes so very long. Even something as simple as getting out of bed in the morning can take hours. If anyone is interested in understanding more about the life of someone with a chronic illness I would love to direct you to ""The Spoon Theory"". It's a very simplistic but beautiful way of expressing what daily life can be like for chronic illness and pain sufferers. I would encourage anyone to read up on it so you can understand what normality is for those people like me who live under the radar with our invisible diseases. You can read all about it HERE.
So here's another problem with the portrayal of chronic pain in the book. It may be stated once or twice that simple tasks take longer etc but I saw no extended periods of fatigue as a result. Cyra was frequently able to fight in a gym type environment... Really??? Like ALL of the time????? Trust me. There are days that no matter how much you try to push through the pain you can't. You just can't. There is insufferable and unending fatigue.
Also; if Cyra was truly in as much pain as she was; she would absolutely have been an insomniac as was stated in the book (case in point I'm writing this review at 4am) but she also would have; at times; passed out from the pain. However; there was one lovely quote I liked that I could very much identify with: That he couldn't feel pain also meant he didn't know about the grey space just beneath consciousness that made it more bearable. I love that grey space. I frequently stay hours in that grey space and don't know where my day has disappeared to all of a sudden. So I needed more moments like this. More explanations to ground Cyra's pain in reality. Pain so often should have consumed her body so much that she would have laid there motionless until unconscious. You often cannot take the pain and that needs to be shown more. It goes to this whole romanticised notion of pain. How suffering is some great beauty.
That brings me to chapter 25 (mild spoiler ahead)
In this chapter Cyra comes to the conclusion that ultimately the gift is the strength the curse has given me... I can bear it. I can bear pain. I can bear anything.
This is insulting and wrong on so many levels. I know that ideologically this is a lovely thought. It goes to the idea that being someone living with pain and fighting through to live another day is admirable.
Look at how stoic she is; so brave; so strong....
So spare me your melodrama!!!
That is an idea for people who don't live with daily pain. It is there; to comfort them. To justify why some people live lives of pain and others don't. It goes to the notion that pain is a burden which is only given to those who are strong enough to carry it.
Not true.
Pain is indiscriminate. Pain corrupts. Pain infiltrates your every fibre of person. It changes you. You don't become strong you become institutionalised to it. You fall back on survival mechanisms. Don't glorify those mechanisms as some sort of admirable strength. I don't want to bear ""anything"" thanks. The pain is quite enough.
It also alludes to a dangerous concept that as pain sufferers we somehow have this skill or ability to take more and more and more. As if we should never feel that the pain is too much???
Trust me; with chronic pain the pain is MUCH too much; and this concept that Cyra thinks that her ability to bear incalculable amounts of pain makes her somehow strong is insulting.
It is okay to not be able to bear unending pain every day.
It is okay to feel like it is too much.
It is okay to need help.
It is okay to not have to suffer in silence.
It is okay to not have to be martyred by pain.
I would also like to have seen a greater emotional impact on Cyra of what it is like to live with pain for so long. I too was a child when pain took hold. I will never forget that first day of experiencing pain. What it was like ripping through my little body.
So where was the hatred? The bitterness?? The why me???
The only self loathing we had on Cyra's part was because of how she inflicted her pain on others and her guilt over that. (Btw; also offensive. I would never wish my pain on another soul so to say that that is something a chronic pain sufferer would do... Yeah... Not impressed!) But I would have much preferred this loathing to be based on the manifestation of her pain and not some outside event.
I haven't even touched on the idea that Cyra's love interest in this story lessens her pain which just adds this book to the myriad of other YA novels out there that tells the reader that love can cure no matter what ails you be it a mental health issue or a physical illness.... At the end of the day; this is a fictional story and Cyra does not suffer from a chronic illness per se (I'm incredibly aware that in future books there is a possibility for a narrative surrounding healing which I hope the author will not explore). But as this is fictional who am I to say that the experiences of Cyra shouldn't be written as they are. Veronica Roth has claimed that she experiences chronic pain and perhaps this is how she feels... It just is not my experience of life with pain.
On the whole this is a very problematic book.
It has issues with poor writing and character development to start with. There are potentially offensive racial undertones; an unflagged trigger warning regarding self-harm and what I believe is an ineffectual representation of chronic pain.
But I don't think that Veronica Roth set out to be racist or ableist or any such thing. I believe that she is just a writer very much out of her depth lacking in proper guidance. I feel there is a sad indictment on the publishing industry that somehow allowed this book to slip through editing and proof reading with the presence of so many questionable aspects.
So my last thoughts on this book are for Ms Roth and for her future writings.
In the words of the great Samuel Beckett:
""Ever tried; ever failed; no matter.
Try again; fail again; fail better.""

Maybe after Divergent my expectations were too high; and it probably not fair to compare the tow although when a book is released saying the writer of Divergent it is hard not to expect a lot and compare the two. Also knowing Veronica Roth was a Star Wars fan and I am a Star Wars fan I figured what could possible go wrong.
The book is very slow then as soon as something exciting happens it is the end of the chapter and the moment is lost. Worse still in some cases of the cross over of the chapters it could be a couple of minutes later; a couple of hours; a day or in one case 2 years. There are a few short but brutal fight scattered around the book. Unfortunately for me there was not particularly well written. I know she thanks a friend who helped her choreograph the fight now in my mind I don't see how someone can strike with a knife with one hand then simultaneously (still in a standing position); remove a hidden blade from their boot and stab the person with it? The narration of the book is split between the two main characters. Cyra Noavek and Akos Kereseth. Like in the Divergent I think Veronica Roth is better a writing the female characters like Cyra. There are also mistakes in Akos narration (yes my grammar is not great so if I noticed it obvious); it is supposed to be first person like Cyra's but as he moves around it keeps he moved here or there he did that like someone is watching him.
Here the Current is the energy/life force believed to flow through everyone. It bestows gifts on everyone some good; some bad and some useless. these gifts seem to be extensions of the person personalities. it is unknown if the person personality brings their ""gift"" or if they are this way because they are going to receive a certain ""gift"". The Current also seems to be harnessed in machines and is the basis for most of their technology. There are also the Oracles people who have been gifted to see the future; but they seem to be a law on to themselves.
The planet Thuvhe is home to both the Thuvhe and Shotet people. Even though it is know interplanetary as Thuvhe. This because the Thuvhe farmers control the worlds biggest export of Hush and Ice flowers. The Shotet seem to be the more vicious and warrior people; and are known for marking kills by scaring their arms. Even though they are supposed to be the more ""closed off"" society they are more traveled people as part of their religious believes is a annual sojourn to a planet directed by the Currents and take there discarded technology and ""garbage"" back for renewal. When the Oracles decide to make peoples fates public the Shotet people make a daring move against the Thuvhe and Akos' family in general. Ryzek Noavek the ruler of Shotet (and Cyra's brother) will do anything to change his fate and show his people he is not weak.
As much as I wanted to like this book I just don't; it is slow paced then skips ahead and tries to fill in blanks later. Also for suck a big book. Not much seems to happen for me too much stuff is left undone especially by the end of the book. if like me you have been fans Roth's previous books; all I can say it did not live up to my expectations.

This book is interesting not because of it's story (which is dull) but because of the circumstances surrounding it's release.
BLACK FACE
Every now and then a book comes along that presents some toxic ideas which are commonly seen in tons of books. But our GoodReads community turns into a hive mind and decides this one book is the absolute worst.
I can't help but feel that this book got unlucky. The Winner's Curse was gushed about despite it's disgusting representation of colonialism and slavery. Sarah Maas had published a dozen books; short stories and novellas before readers started to grumble about the lack of LGBT characters. Mark Lawrence; Prince of Thorns and Patrick Rothfuss got almost no flack for their sexist stereotypes.
So the question becomes- are people outraged by the offensive stereotypes or are they just unable to ignore them because the story was subpar?
Race in fantasy is a difficult thing. Most writers avoid it entirely; it's a chronic truism that if the book is a fantasy then you can assume everyone is white. In Carve the Mark I'm not sure there was any way for Roth to avoid this controversy. She set up a situation in which two cultures clash. Providing any sort of racial markers to either group was going to cause a reaction.
For the criticism of ableism- all I can really add is people who experience disability or chronic pain are likely to have the clearest perspective on this but since there are entire spiritual practices devoted to incorporating pain into knowledge of god it would probably be useful to remember that there is not one right way to write about difficult experiences. The most useful discussion around this stuff is seeing if the writer correctly identified a possible response to a human experience. They aren't representing your experience. If every time a writer tried to write about an experience they don't have personal knowledge of they got lambastedâ€¦ well good luck getting any marginalised experiences into print.
Perhaps the backlash against this novel will be an important marker to writers and publishers alike? God knows I've gritted my teeth thru enough ""white saviour""; ""black aggressor""; ""magical negro"" and ""noble savage"" stereotypes to be eager to see these tropes die out. Maybe Roth's new book is the bloody sacrifice needed to make publishers sit up and take notice? In which case this mediocre book can be said to have done some real good in the literary world.
But I can't help suspecting this novel will be thrown on a pyre righteous of indignation like other outliers before it is ignobly forgotten.
Readers will continue to eat up sexist and racist stories because the characters are swoon worthy; the plot is thrilling or the reader's who object are ""oversensitive sjw's"".
This controversy is food for thought for writers and readers alike. Despite what some people claim stories are important cultural indicators. They shape and define how we experience and respond to the world around us. A story is never ""just a story"" and I'm pleased to see so many fellow readers engaging with subtext and connotation; rather then reviews full of gifs saying ""omfg love interest is soooo hawt"".
BLOOD MONEY
The second thing worth noting was the volume of paid reviews this book has on the front page. There are a ton of studies that show how being financially paid to review a product unconsciously inflates reviewers' scores. This is the first novel I've come across on GR were the front page was saturated with paid reviews. GR has been fiercely defended as a place created for readers by readers (and the bloody remnants of many writing careers can still be found scattered across the site).
In a world of tightly controlled image creation GR members have managed to carve out a space that can be downright vicious to anyone who tries to infiltrate the community for commercial purposes.
As a community we need to think carefully about accepting paid reviews as a common practice. It destroys authenticity. Most regular users are voracious readers. It would be wonderful if we could all earn a living by reading books. But here's the thing: you won't. Even if a tiny fraction of readers manage to earn a living wage reviewing books it will be at the cost of their personal integrity and the community's effectiveness. Goodreads works because it is real. It is genuine word of mouth supercharged across the globe. Marketers might be drooling to get a slice of the PR pie but we as members decide whether that is organic; authentic acclaim or... not.
There is a very real risk if this trend continues that GR will become an advertisement billboard. Our choices now will determine the future of goodreads.
If you see a review that is paid for don't like it. Let the other member know you are unhappy with their decision to accept payment for a review. These are two really easy things members can do to curb these trends. If paid reviews get no ""likes"" and languish on the 20th page publishers won't bother trying to curate the book's image. Likewise; if members see that accepting paid reviews breaks their friends trust; they won't accept them.
How we address commercial encroachment in Good Reads matters. I don't come to GR to read 30 paid ads on the book I'm about to read; do you?
Edit: Some booktubers and reviewers have vigorously defended themselves. I wanted to add evidence to my claim that the inflation in reviews occurs even where the reviewers believe they are being objective :
https://reviewmeta.com/blog/analysis-...
Although this refers to amazon reviews I think it provides sufficient evidence for the same problem on GR.
For further evidence of how fucked up it is having sponsored reviews on goodreads see Riley's review Which describes how her contact was dissolved when she notified the publisher she would be writing a negative review.

1. This book tries to YA too hard
2. This book tries to Sci-fi too hard
3. This book tries to world build too hard
I do give it 3 stars because overall I found it enjoyable; but the the things above distracted me so much. (Note: Lowered to two stars on 10/17/2017 because I thought I already gave it too and I keep thinking back to how much I didn't care for it . . . so; I had to drop it!)
YA - There is a general YA formula; but if you mix it in well with a creative story; it doesn't matter if it has the same themes and general plot lines. This book wore YA on its sleeve - young love between enemies; siblings trying to save each other; every main character except the protagonists parents is between the age of 14 and 19. I could go on.
Sci-fi - I am still not sure why interplanetary travel was important in this story; but it happened. Mysterious powers that just so happen to be the most advantageous to the person who has them or convenient to the storyline. It really felt like Roth just wanted this book to be in space and threw out some special high tech weirdness to make it feel like other Sci-fi YA offerings (I was frequently reminded of Red Rising - which I did not care for very much)
World building - Oh man; names; locations; traditions; races - one big confusing mashup! This distracted me the most. So many weird names and odd relationships I had a hard time keeping track of what was going on. The locations and travel were not very clear (see Sci-fi above). I couldn't tell if they were on one planet; several planets; what the ultimate political structure was; etc. Maybe all this is clear for some; but I was lost a lot of the time.
Despite all of this; though; I did enjoy the story and was not disappointed in the plot and cliffhangers for a sequel. I just hope Roth doesn't try so hard to do what is expected. (less)",551,NEXTBOOK

I read this before anyone and didn't see the underlying issues everyone saw with the story until a few of my friends told me about all the explosions on social media sites I don't even have.

Wow. I justâ€¦there are times when the words flow out of me in torrents and I canâ€™t stop no matter how hard I try; but then there are times when I have literally one million things to sayâ€¦and no idea how to say them. This book touched me in a way Iâ€™m not often used to-at least; not anymore. A long time ago; when I finally found my favorite genres and what made me the happiest; I was finding a seamless stream of five star books because I had finally found what worked for me. But lately; those streams of winners are harder to come by.
For one; Iâ€™m extremely picky now-I know what I like; down to the very last word; and anything less is unacceptable. Itâ€™s no secret to any of my friends that I love all things mayhem; death; destruction; forbidden love mixed with peril peril peril. But not many authors truly; truly give you all those things at once. Itâ€™s so rare; anyway. And; because itâ€™s so rare; those authors who do deliver on all things nasty and despicable in the name of love make it impossible to forget who they are.

Now; Iâ€™m not saying the stories donâ€™t eventually end happilyâ€¦but they leave you with some very nasty cliffhangers. Did I happen to mention that nasty; white-knuckle cliffhangers are literally my favorite thing EVER?? So; these authors; they never shy away from doing what they need to pack a devastating punch. I never go all in when my head isnâ€™t in the right place-after all; even the most dastardly and peril obsessed reviewers need a break from all the heart-break. We arenâ€™t robots; ya know?? And; after a while; if you read hardcore books one after the other; you are bound to become a little bit jaded.

So; when I was offered this beauty from the publishers of Veronica Rothâ€™s newest MASTERPIECE; I; of course; accepted. For one; what an honor-little olâ€™ me; getting a book from a best-selling MEGA FAMOUS author before most of the world. Itâ€™s crazy; and I did not look a gift horse in mouth-I didnâ€™t hesitate in responding. Secondly; I adored-ABSOLUTELY ADORED-the Divergent trilogy. And not just the first two-all three. Veronica Roth; while a very cunning and devious woman; is someone I wholly admire. Her writing is poetic and flows effortlessly from paragraph to paragraph; page to page. I have ALWAYS lumped her in with my favorite poetic authors.
â€œA knife;â€ I said. â€œA hot poker. A rusty nail.â€
â€œYou are more than any of those things.â€
And; while she isnâ€™t someone I think of weekly; or even monthly; I have never forgotten her after her shocking finale to the Divergent series. The â€what-ifâ€™s and â€what will she do nextâ€™s were never far from my mindâ€¦it has just taken a while to finally see a new book in the works from this spectacular woman.
â€œAnd youâ€™re starting to sound kind of cocky; for someone I routinely beat up.â€
I know many people are weary of what comes next from the daring author who shocked the world (and that is the LAST time I will mention her former series; because it is doing a great injustice to this beautiful book); and I know there are going to be a million comparisons-itâ€™s just inevitable. But I truly saw something so amazing here-something I never thought Iâ€™d see. It would be such a shame to not give this duology a chance because of an uncertain future and phobia of the past. I know everyone is quick to fall in love with main characters (I fell so hard; so fast for these two new characters that it shocked even me) and people are quick to protect those they love---but the love I feel for these two AMAZING characters is so unparalleled; and permanent; that I must insist on reading this the moment it comes out.
When I looked at him again; he was smiling at me hesitantly.
â€œYou love them;â€ he said. â€œAll these places; all these things.â€
Iâ€™ll admit that I was scared of the prospect of space travel-and for that matter; space lingo-but not once did I ever slow down or feel lost as I was racing through this fast-paced; addicting story. And thatâ€™s my favorite thing-I never wanted to put this book down. Rothâ€™s passion was reflected on each and every page; echoing to us in a new; inventive way with each arising issue. Each character was created in a delicate manner; making for layered; flawed; and believable characters. These were people you wanted to root for; and you never really knew if they were going to win-in both mental and physical scenarios.
""You and I; weâ€™ve become what we were made to become.â€
Their minds were tested in unimaginable and barbaric ways; twisting what they believed and hoped for in life to the point of utter despair. Loyalties were bent and broken; repaired and restored-the boundaries of love and family snuffed out in a manner of minutes. You were forced to pick a side and surviveâ€¦whether you wanted to or not.
The same thing she always did; only now he noticed-noticed that he knew it; that was; knew her routines; knew her.
And liked her.
Akos is from the peace loving Thuvhe; a wintery world where you have to wear goggles to walk around outside. Itâ€™s beauty is unparalleled to its inhabitants; crystallized and serene and snowy as can be. Grays are the norm; much like the environmentâ€¦which can be seen as dull to others. Cyra is Noavek-Brutal and unforgiving Shotet tyrants who wear blue. Their beliefs couldnâ€™t be any different; nor could the difference in style of life: One place bloodthirsty; unrelenting in its quest for power and dominance. Pain is no stranger here. You can immediately see why our two main characters are the way they are; and you instantly feel for both. Sides are hard to choose and lines are blurredâ€¦as becomes evident the farther into the story we get.
And here comes the good stuff; the stuff that makes this beautiful love story possible. Forbidden loveâ€¦isnâ€™t it the best thing ever; when done correctly? Yeah. I think so; too. Cyraâ€™s currentgift is pain; Akosâ€™s is to diffuse peopleâ€™s gift. Both very valuable currentgiftsâ€¦and both susceptible to manipulation and vulnerable to almost everyone. When paired together without a say in the matter; they realize they can be an asset to one another. Neither is willing to put all their trust in the other; but they also donâ€™t fight what seems to be a tentative alliance. After all; itâ€™s nice having someone who understands you (to a degree); someone who is there to take some of the burden away; who wants to help (again; to a degree-they do have differing conclusions to what they believe to be their story).
â€œHonor;â€ I said with a snort. â€œHonor has no place in survival.â€
But; as they get closer; what was once clear begins to become a convoluted cloud of emotions and hope-could they possibly want the same thing?? Is she truly a monster; or can she still be someone who helps make the world a better place? Does she want to help Akosâ€¦even at the expense of going against her only brother?
Akosâ€™s kindness was something that resonated deeply within me right away-but; even more than that; his gradual fierceness. Heâ€™s not perfect; nor is he indestructible; but his silent fury mixed with an unrelenting kindness made him an instant book boyfriend that I was absolutely obsessed with. And then Cyra-one of my favorite female leads of all time. Some might say I even have a girl crush. Yeah-serious stuff; right?
â€œNext time; when something that sounds remarkably like war drums is going to wake me at dawn; could you maybe warn me?â€
Cyra deals with pain 24/7. Literally-all day; all night-no matter what. Until she dispenses that pain into an unwilling victim; causing them pain so severe they would reveal their deepest; darkest secrets. She is numb to the power now; her brotherâ€™s little torture device. Cunning; witty; and skilled in combat like nobodyâ€™s business; she is not to be trifled with-seriously; sheâ€™s so badass. But-and probably why my girl crush (on top of my book boyfriend crush (so much win)) is shining so bright-she wasnâ€™t so strong she didnâ€™t have vulnerability or weakness. She lost sometimes. She didnâ€™t always make the right choices. And; if Iâ€™m comparing here; I kept thinking of a female book character I really didnâ€™t like...she kind of made up the anatomy of Cyra; here.
It was not hope; it did not soar; it slithered; clawed; and dragged; and it would not let me stop.
I saw a lot Adelina from Marie Luâ€™s most recent trilogy. Dark; corrupted; and willing to do what she had to for those she loved-and herself. She had to relieve the pain sometimes; you know? Itâ€™s not all about choice. But; see; I hated Adelina. She was okay; I guess; but I found her pathetic and whiny-not here. Cyra took the BEST PARTS of Adelina and made her someone I adored. Okay; I didnâ€™t really read the second or third books of that trilogy; nor is there a direct line that connected these characters in any way-I just got the vibe; that feeling; and I dug it.
""I like to move.""
""I've noticed.""
She is a tool of destruction; of torture; she is a key to be used in war-she can bring any one person to their knees with her amazing power-but she is vulnerable to the pain; and to herself-she is resigned to be the monster she was fated to be. But not ONCE does she whine about it-itâ€™s her life and she lives with it dailyâ€¦And I found that so amazing. She just goes about her life in suffering; trying to (at Akosâ€™s influence) be the best she can be. And; again; she doesnâ€™t always succeed. Did I mention I love her? And Akos? And I ship them? Hm. Well. Iâ€™ll say it again: they are everything to me.
He offered touch to me so freely; without realizing how rare it was. How rare he was; to a person like me.
So; as you can see; Iâ€™m hooked. I was hooked from the first part that was in his POV; and I was sunk-line and sinker-when I met Cyra. These two were made for one another; but born enemies. They donâ€™t want to like each other; and they donâ€™t always understand; but...things happen. And isnâ€™t slow burn romance the best kind of romance (especially paired with forbidden romance-HA thought you caught me there; didnâ€™t you)?? Rothâ€™s writing was; as promised; better than ever and even a bit more mature; if thatâ€™s even possible. She writes in a way you donâ€™t once get confused about; no matter the content; and makes you physically ache for more. Itâ€™s been a long time since I was so stressed out I couldnâ€™t breathe; but more than once I found myself gasping for breath and clutching my heart-stopping and staring at the page with wide eyes as I tried to calm my breathing (maybe this partially has to do with being pregnant; but I say no; I was just super excitable because...excellence at work; people) and get myself under control. I smiled so big without even realizing it that it bordered on embarrassing. I tried; and failed; repeatedly to find errors with the book and why my best of friends wouldnâ€™t like the story (or anyone; for that matter; if Iâ€™m being honest); but never once could think of anything. And; if there was something; it was nit-picky and I completely missed it. I donâ€™t know if this book is for everybody; or even what everyone else will think-All I can do is go with my heart and my gut; and they both say this is a winner. I know; without a doubt; that when this releases it will be my (late) Christmas gift to all friends and family that read. I know itâ€™s a certainty I will be rushing to Barnes and Noble on release day to buy myself a hardback of this new absolute favorite. I have found three favorite books this year; all by amazing authors almost everyone lovesâ€¦and this book tops them all. So; my hope is; with this long-winded review; that Iâ€™ve convinced or intrigued almost everyone to give this book a shot. And; for those who are not so easily swayed (or manipulated); honestly; its their loss.

Divergent Wars: One Force will define you.
Curious (and polite) people kept asking me if I was enjoying CARVE THE MARK while I was reading it. For the flippant response to that question; please refer to the opening of the song ""Nobody But Me"" by The Human Beinz. Or; you know; check out my star rating. (But my way is more fun; and you get a fun song out of it; too!)
I was one of the few people who did not like DIVERGENT. Part of that was the world-building that didn't make sense; and part of that was what I perceived as jarring anti-intellectualism. You might say I'm being oversensitive. Maybe. Or maybe the author's choice to make the intellectual faction into what were basically a bunch of fascists did not sit well with me. And no; I'm not just saying that because I scored as ""erudite"" in that stupid faction quiz. (Well; mostly. *sniff; sniff* I'm not a fascist!)
When I heard that Roth was penning a new series of books; I was skeptical. Especially when it was being blurbed as a cross between Star Wars and DIVERGENT. I liked one of those things very much; but would space opera and the compelling promise of vengeance and battles be enough to compensate for the DIVERGENT similarities? And; more importantly; how would her style evolve? Or would it be more BS about smart people wrecking society and brave people jumping out of trains?
CARVE THE MARK is a very weird book - and; to its credit; is a very different story from DIVERGENT. It's about the Thuhve; a ""peace-loving"" people; and the Shotet; an opportunistic and war-like people who are ruled by a ""tyrant"" and who carve marks denoting their kills into their forearms. Akos; the Thuhvian; is taken capture by the Shotet's ruler; Rhyzek; along with his brother; because his brother has the power of prophecy. Cyra is Rhyzek's sister; and has the ability to cause people incredible pain - or even death - upon physical contact. Rhyzek uses her to do his dirty work and to put fear into his people.
The power source in this book is something called the ""current;"" which from what I gathered is like a cross between the ""Lifestream"" in Final Fantasy VII and the Force in Star Wars. It's a physical thing of immense power that people can draw upon; creating ""currentblades"" (e.g. lightsabers) and being born with ""currentgifts"" (e.g. the Force) that manifest in different ways to do different things.
Okay; cool. A little derivative; but hey; super powers aren't exactly a novel concept; and I'm always down to read about them if done well. What's 100% original these days; anyway? Exactly.
But I could not get into CARVE THE MARK at all. It felt very amateurish. It was too long; and the characters were not developed at all. At least Tris had some emotional complexity to her and the romance between Four and Tris was compelling (and arguably the best part of the story). On the other hand; the romance between Cyra and Akos has zero chemistry; and when they start talking about being in love with each other it comes totally out of left field because; again; zero evidence for it (that I perceived - by that point; I was skimming pretty heavily; and I may have missed a telltale ""clue"").
CARVE THE MARK read like a very bad debut for me; with shoddy world building; a cliche and cowardly villain; and two heroes who don't really have any interesting personality traits or conflicts. I'm honestly shocked by how unpleasant the experience of reading this was; and if I had read this without knowing who the author was; I might have thought that this was a cleaned-up self-published effort or a debut tentatively put forth by a first-time (and very young) author.
I'm honestly disappointed because I love space opera - it's one of my favorite genres - and I was hoping to see a mainstream author write a glowing example of it; because if space opera boomed like the dystopian genre did in the late 2000s; I'd be one happy gal.
Maybe it will; but let's not make this book the poster child for the movement.

Having spent the last hour reading through Review 1; Review 2; Tweets; opinion posts; in addition to the comments threads; there seems to be a whole lot of furore about this book which; I must say; now has me intrigued enough to want to read Carve the Mark.
A few reviewers felt the need to disclaim previous reviews; while some bloggers sought to distance themselves from both the author and HarperTeen; the publishers. My understanding is that one; the book has racial undertones; the author's allusion to chronic pain as a source of strength for one of the characters is another problematic issue.
Empathy; I understand. What has me concerned is that I haven't read; yet; a review from a person of color. Should any of my friends have a review from a POC; please; feel free to share. Nevertheless; I will set aside the 20+ (laugh/scoff; you know you want to) ""currently-reading"" books to gladly dive into this one. Will I find it offensive? Perhaps; but what I know you all know is; I'll be 100% real.

I'm still struggling to figure what words are appropriate to describe the mediocrity and utter pointlessness of this book. My thoughts about it aren't as concise as this review will turn out being; because I only have so many words to fit in my review space and I want to illustrate why this book ended up being such a horrible experience. It's my worst read of 2017 thus far; though I considered giving it credit for at least the last quarter of the book holding my attention (Honestly though; slogging through 80% of this only to get to intriguing scenes of action/character stake investment? Not worth it; definitely not worth it) . I'm a fast reader; it wasn't the length of this book that deterred me - my library copy clocked in just around 460 some pages - but this book was such a tedious; offensive mess.
Before I address the most pervasively discussed problems in this narrative (i.e. how racist and and ablelist this book is on several levels. There isn't an argument to be made about that - it exists in this book even if the author herself doesn't realize that it does in this narrative; and I picked up on it in several instances in this narrative; probably more than I can direct quote in this review. I'll do my best to illustrate these points using quotes from the text where I can; though); I'll discuss the aspects of this book that are a little easier for me to address in quick notation.
As a bit of background; I had actually planned to read this book quite a while back. My experiences with Roth's books have been rocky to say the least. I thought ""Divergent"" was okay (though with issues); ""Insurgent"" was less okay (with more issues; but it held my attention still) and ""Allegiant"" was just...not good is putting it mildly. But I figured I'd give ""Carve the Mark"" a chance because it had all the bullet points of a series I might like. It's sci-fi; it's set in space; involves political intrigue and manipulation of powers/unique abilities of its cast; has some romantic inclinations; and involves a purportedly epic clash between different groups of people. (I'm deliberately ignoring the comparisons to Star Wars/X-Men because that sets up unrealistic expectations; and I don't buy into that kind of hype.)
I started hearing about issues with this narrative on the day of release; and several of my Goodreads friends and trusted bloggers had mixed reactions to it as well. I'm thinking ""Oh crud; glad I didn't preorder it. I still want to read it; maybe I should just get it from the library if it doesn't have ten billion holds."" On one of my routine trips to my library; I saw the book on the shelf and was wondering like ""Can I actually check this out?"" Turns out I could; and I did; and my initial thoughts were whether I was lucky to get one or if I'd set myself up for disappointment.
The long and short of ""Carve the Mark's"" story centers on the conflict between two space societies: the Thuvue and the Shotet. People in this world have unique abilities called currentgifts; which by definition in the glossary of the story ""develop during puberty. They are not always benevolent."" The story attempts to showcase the perspectives of Akos and Cyra from those nations respectively. Akos and his brother Eijeh; after a series of violent events; are kidnapped by the Shotet and made to use their currentgifts for the benefit of Cyra's family. Eijeh is subjected under the influence of Cyra's tyrannical brother Rhyzek; while Akos uses his abilities to aid Cyra. Cyra is a young woman whose existence is tormented by her currentgift; but yet she enacts her brother's will by serving as a weapon under his direct command. Cyra doesn't want to hurt anyone or serve as her brother's weapon in their kingdom; but her ability impedes her and can't escape the guilt of a secret (read: not so secret) that hangs over her head - both by her brother's influence and her own guilt.
Cyra and Akos have a rocky relationship with competing interests at first; but as they learn about each other's experiences; they grow closer romantically and end up making plans to take Rhyzek down. Of course this journey isn't without a few curveballs (supposedly; I honestly didn't find them that shocking) the narrative throws at the reader in the end; and apparently leaves to continue in this purported duology.
While this summary of the story wouldn't seem so terrible when taken by that barebones approach; there were so many things wrong with ""Carve The Mark"" in execution that it's difficult to know where to begin. The pacing in the novel is atrociously sluggish; starting with very little conflict or explanation and meandering more often than not (I found this to be a similar problem in Roth's ""Alliegiant""). The worldbuilding is weakly drawn from the beginning; and the presentation of the world is awkward and confusing. For a book that blends sci-fi and fantasy in a space centered universe - there's never a chance to become immersed or invested in the environment. Granted; this is a universe where Oracles determine the fates of people with currentgifts and note how their gifts influence the balance of power between the societies. Akos and Cyra come from two powerful families and have powerful gifts that they develop over time; though there isn't much attention to the system by which this works (what little there is comes across as confusing). ""Carve the Mark"" trades between their perspectives; starting with Akos in third person; while Cyra's perspective is written in first person POV.
It was hard to care for any of the cast of characters in this book other than Cyra. Cyra had the more prominent storyline and scenetime; while Akos's perspective suffered from being too emotionally distant despite some purportedly harrowing experiences. Add to the fact that Roth chose to telegraph certain experiences and emotions of the characters - withholding certain revelations key to the storyline for no particular reason at all (and you could guess what those revelations were without getting too far into the storyline - I predicted them fairly quickly.) The narrative would've benefited from them being shown and fleshed out much more than the attention they received. So; the writing and establishment of the plot was much weaker than it would've otherwise been with greater care and time taken to develop the world. Don't even get me started on the one-note side characters and villains. For a reportedly violent sci-fi world with prominent clashes; when certain characters bit the bullet; I found it hard to care because I really didn't feel like I knew the characters in this novel that well. Even Ryzek's motivations felt paperthin despite the attempt to showcase his flaws and eventually the rationale he uses to manipulate his sister into being his weapon of choice to enact his assertion of power.
Cyra and Akos's characters had a few scenes where I could believe in their chemistry and slow burning relationship; but I felt my connection to them was shortchanged because of the way the narrative chose to not only push them together for convenient circumstance; but ultimately the narrative becoming another example in problematic YA tropes for I can heal your problems with the power of love!
These are just the mentions of structural and narrative issues with ""Carve the Mark"" without mentioning the problematic presentation of themes and depictions in the work. And it's perhaps the racist and ableist depictions that showcase not only how lazy the construction of this work really was; but how it attempted to incorporate such themes in a flawed and insensitive way.
It may be ironic of me to point out this video of Roth talking about the importance of portrayal of race in this narrative but I honestly think that despite the intention of *trying* to be inclusive of different races with her intentional incorporation of skin tones and hair textures - she completely misses the point of what it means to be inclusive.
When you are writing minority characters accurately; you are dealing with more than just an incorporation of skin tones. I think that point bears repeating: When you are writing minority characters accurately; you are dealing with more than just an incorporation of skin tones. Part of the problem with certain portrayals of minority groups in fiction; including in sci-fi and fantasy; is that there's a history of harmful stereotypes of minority groups in comparison to White/Caucasian or majority groups. This stereotyping is very evident in numerous areas of ""Carve the Mark"". I felt that Justina Ireland did a fine job of pointing out just a few of these problems alongside quoting some examples where this is noted in the text. But these are only just a few examples.
This book was ethnocentric from the very beginning against the Shotet group; and that never changed through the entire story.
Chapter 1: ""The Shotet were a people; not a nation-planet; and they were known to be fierce; brutal. They stained lines into their arms for every life they had taken; and trained even their children in the art of war. And they lived on Thuvhe; the same planet as Akos and his familyâ€”though the Shotet didnâ€™t call this planet â€œThuvhe;â€ or themselves â€œThuvhesitsâ€â€”across a huge stretch of feathergrass. The same feathergrass that scratched at the windows of Akosâ€™s familyâ€™s house.""
â€œSometimes it is easy to see why people become what they are;â€ his mom said softly. â€œRyzek and Cyra; children of a tyrant. Their father; Lazmet; child of a woman who murdered her own brothers and sisters. The violence infects each generation.â€ <- This is Akos's mother telling him about how harmful the Shotet people are. (Prejudice is a dish served cold in this narrative; apparently.)
Chapter 2: Akos knew it without really knowing it: These men were Shotet. Enemies of Thuvhe; enemies of theirs. People like this were responsible for every candle lit in the memorial of the Shotet invasion; they had scarred Hessaâ€™s buildings; busted its glass so it showed fractured images; they had culled the bravest; the strongest; the fiercest; and left their families to weeping. Akosâ€™s grandmother and her bread knife among them; so said their dad. <- There's the dehumanization and use of ""they"" - think ""Save the Pearls"" problematic attributions.
â€œNo woman;â€ one of the men said to one of the others. â€œWonder where she is?â€
â€œOracle;â€ one of the others replied. â€œNot an easy one to catch.â€
â€œI know you speak our language;â€ Aoseh said; sterner this time. â€œStop jabbering away like you donâ€™t understand me."" Because you would have your darker skinned enemies speak a broken form of your prevalent language.
Chapter 3: â€œToday;â€ she told me; â€œis the first day that most Shotet will lay eyes on you; not to mention the rest of the galaxy. The last thing we want is for them to fixate on your hair. By fixing it up; we make it invisible. Understand?â€
I didnâ€™t; but I didnâ€™t press the issue. I was looking at my motherâ€™s hair. It was dark; like mine; but a different textureâ€”hers was so curly it trapped fingers; and mine was just straight enough to escape them. My mouth dropped open at this inclusion because it's bad enough that people of color are often degraded by their natural hair types or forced to conform to some standard of beauty; and this serves to reinforce cultural self-hate of appearances in favor of the ""majority"" group's hair type. WTF man?
Chapter 15: â€œIâ€™m not a fool; no matter what you people think of the Thuvhesit;â€ Akos snapped; his cheeks going ruddy as he picked up the practice blade. â€œYou think Iâ€™m going to just let you set me up for a fall?â€ <- ""You people"" again. Dehumanizing language.
â€œSo you; what? Leap straight to killing him? What is it with you Shotet?â€ Akos said in a low voice. Akos says this to a Shotet person who makes a bargain with him; involving killing someone. Casual prejudicial assumptions even from the LI. Ugh. This is an offshoot of the same conversation in the mention above.
There are a number of times when Cyra participates in her own self-hatred for identity; not just for what she's done and the secret she holds; but also her own ease of disposition for violence. This is contrasted against Akos; for when he subjects himself to a contract kill versus killing for survival; he's disgusted and nearly breaks down over the death. One could almost argue that in some ways Cyra corrupts him and he ""fixes"" her as his love interest; which I thought was pretty messed up in the context of the story.
As far as the ableism goes; this book portrays such in two dimensions: chronic pain and self-harm/attributions to self-cutting. This narrative portrays the Shotet in demonizing way with respect to the novel's namesake ""Carve the Mark"".
Chapter 15: Akos rubbed at the marks by his elbow; and thought of the savagery of them. Keep in mind this is a custom of the Shotet; and figures that he'd refer to it in some way as being ""savage.""
The most damning quote I found was one I partially quoted in my status updates.
Chapter 14: ""Says the person whoâ€™s been scarring herself for things she was coerced into doing;â€ he said wryly.
It wasnâ€™t funny; what either of us was saying. And then it was. I grinned; and after a moment; so did he. A new grinâ€”not the one that told me he was proud of himself; or the one that he forced when he felt like he needed to be polite; but a thirsty; crazed kind of smile. Basically the context of this is that Cyra was talking about how she marked herself not for the number of kills she made with her ability but for every time she had pain. I think this is triggering for people who may have recovered from some degree of self-harm/cutting. And the fact that Akos and Cyra laugh about it made me want to throw the book down in disgust; even if it is bitter/dark humor. It's not funny.
And definitely not cool to romanticize chronic pain in the form of an attempted sacrifice:
Chapter 25: Akosâ€™s eyesâ€”full of tears; full of painâ€”found mine. Pushing the shadow toward him would have been easy. I had done it many times before; each time a mark on my left arm. All I had to do was let the connection form; let the pain pass between us like a breath; like a kiss. Let all of it flow out of me; bringing relief for us both; in death.
But he did not deserve it.
This time; I broke the connection; like slamming a door between us. I pulled the pain back; into myself; willing my body to grow darker and darker; like a bottle of pink. I shuddered with the force of that power; that agony.
I didnâ€™t scream. I wasnâ€™t afraid. I knew I was strong enough to survive it all.
I feel like there were more problems in this book than I could care to cite as far as the portrayals were concerned. I understood that this was supposed to be a narrative showcasing two very flawed characters put in extraordinary circumstances and brought together under those terms; but taking and appropriating from established cultures and loosely building a narrative with many haphazard stereotypes; some even affirming awful and harmful attributions; is really messed up. Romanticizing pain; including measures out of the control of the person suffering from it; isn't acceptable either.
I definitely won't be reading the next book in this series. And I'm unlikely even to pick up another narrative by Roth in the future.
Overall score: 1/5 stars. (less)",556,NEXTBOOK

Sana and I are bored and are being put in a reading slump reading this. It's extremely slow and boring and nothing interesting has happened. We encountered some of the issues going on and asked each other if it was triggering for either of us and since it wasn't; we continued. I do agree that this does have issues that can be triggering for people; so I suggest watching out for that before starting it. We also have read like 2 more pages since our last update (pg. 108) and stopped there. The book is just boring; overall; and I haven't been reading ever since.
We tried; but the trying has to stop now. It's no surprise that this buddy read didn't work since it never works out for us. Sana I swear buddy reads don't like us.
3/3/17: Buddy read with this evil child. Like Sana; I'm either gonna hate this or love this because of the mixed reviews it has.
2/26/17: I haven't read this book; but I was just looking at the reviews and so many readers have deleted their rating (only the rating) and added notes to the review saying this book deals with problematic issues that can be taken as offensive including ableism; racism; and disrespect. I still am gonna read this; but I'm not gonna write a review. I'll probably rate it; and I will look for the issues it has; but writing a review won't be necessary since it's already become a big problem.
I don't know what it is; but there are some links here that talk about the book and give out some of the points on how this book has issues that people should look out for:

Yey; I finally finished reading this controversial book. Before I even picked it up; I did some extensive research just because so many people were ranting about it. I watched reviews on YouTube; which were rarely positive in tone. Heck; I even saw a video wherein the BookTuber burst into tears because of all the stress this book had been giving her. Of course; I was quite moved by all of the drama surrounding the release of Carve the Mark. Still; I wanted to remain as objective as possible; so I also perused the Web for Veronica Roth's written and recorded responses. After reading her blog post (which addressed the issues of racism and ableism); I eventually mustered enough courage to read this book. To my surprise; it was a month-long journey.
Carve the Mark is a thousand miles away from the Divergent Trilogy. The novel is set in a fantastical universe where a literally flowing entity called the Current surrounds nine unique planets. If you've read Under the Never Sky by Veronica Rossi; you can imagine the Current as the aurora-borealis-like Aether. Personally; the Current reminded me of the Lifestream in Final Fantasy VII. :D Anyways; like the Aether in UTNS; the Current in CTM gives humans supernatural abilities. However; in the case of Cyra Noavek; her gift is more like a curse because it racks her body (and others) with constant pain. The story kicks off when she meets Akos Kereseth; a supposed enemy who can nullify the Current and thereby ease her pain. (Trigger warning for Feminists xD)
From the get go; I want you to know that I wasn't so hurt or bothered by this book. Thankfully; it did not overwhelm me with angst; hatred; or sadness. If anything; the worst feeling it evoked in me was boredom. The first hundred pages were especially info-dumpy; and I found myself struggling to stay awake. It didn't help that there were so many side characters with ridiculous names. With that in mind; reading this book required a lot of effort and patience.
My reading experience became somewhat better when I became familiar with the complex world and the author's quite different writing style (i.e. Cyra's chapters are in first person; while Akos's are in third person). I was specifically intrigued by Cyra's interactions with her villainous brother; Ryzek. In spite of their filial connection; it was clear that they did not love each other at all. As for the romance between Cyra and Akos; I thought that it was reminiscent to that of Divergent's Tris and Four. How so? It also happened because of multiple training sessions. Ha-ha. Looking at the bright side; at least what they had was not instalove.
Among the many characters in this book; Cyra was strangely my favorite. I found her very entertaining because she exhibited what I like to call Tris Syndrome. Like Tris; Cyra wasn't aware of the fine line between bravery and stupidity. Also; she could be selfless to a fault. Basically; Cyra's uncanny similarity to Tris gave me a feeling of nostalgia; as well as a cynical kind of pleasure. :p
As a final note; I can confirm that this might trigger readers who have suffered from self-harm; There are scenes where the protagonists use heated knives to scar their arms. As for the racism issue; I actually did not detect any kind of discrimination against people of color; not all Shotet are dark-skinned ""barbarians;"" and not all Thuvesits are pale-skinned ""hippies.""
Overall; I am glad that I gave Veronica Roth the benefit of the doubt. Still; I cannot say that this is her finest work. Otherwise; this book wouldn't have been so controversial. (less)",558,NEXTBOOK

---
â€œGrowing up here really has warped you; hasnâ€™t it?â€
â€œGrowing up here;â€ I clarified; â€œhas made me see the truth about people.â€
â€¢I feel that a foreword is needed here.
First; I read the Divergent trilogy a little over two years ago; before the first movie -the only one I watched- was released; and the series as a whole impressed me so little I reckon my mind let my memories of it fade by default. So if what you need is a detailed comparison between the Divergent series and Carve the Mark; this is not the review you're looking for.
Secondly; I feel duty-bound to let you know that Carve the Mark has raised issues regarding racism and cultural stereotypes and the author's thoughts about chronic illnesses -also with reference to this interview. Here I won't comment on the substance of the matter; I'll only say that before starting the book; I had no idea of the uproar surrounding it; and that I didn't find out until later; when I was almost done with it. Which means; yes; that I picked up none of these issues while reading; but then again; I am white and I have no first-hand experience of what it means to cope with a chronic condition; so I do not fall into that category of people who are likely to be touched by them. I feel like it's not my place to pass judgement on this; so please do not be offended by my not-totally-negative opinion of the book. I mean no disrespect whatsoever; I am glad that the problem has been duly pointed out and I'm sorry for all the readers who may have been hurt by this.
â€¢Strangely enough; when it comes to this novel I seem to be more inclined to dwell on the things I won't talk about than on those few points I could actually wring something out of. First things first; then: I was deeply fascinated with the concept lying at the basis of this world-building; namely; this unspecified current that flows across the whole universe; and to which the gifts; special powers that manifest differently for each individual; are due. The explanation of this phenomenon is that since each person is unique; when the energy of the current fills them; it takes different shapes; and hence the difference in the powers. I found this idea very simple; yet very suggestive; and logically convincing too; which is never to be undervalued.
â€¢Sadly; this single fact was the only thing that genuinely struck me as original and truly thought-out. The rest of the world building was to me not bad; but rather dull and unsurprising; and not perfectly laid out if we're being honest. In this world; many -some? Anyway; more than one- planets are inhabited by humans; but I couldn't gather exactly how many and why; plus; the names of these planets and their peoples are mentioned more than once along with inconsequential facts like; for instance; that Ogra culture worships mystery (what does that even mean; for goodness sake) but that doesn't help you getting a clearer picture at all. It basically fills up your mind with random names you're bound to forget once the paragraph is over.
â€¢The pace -good gracious; the pace. It's no secret that Veronica Roth never really knew what to do with this alien thing; and the obvious result is; I got bored with Insurgent; I got bored with Allegiant; and I got bored with Carve the Mark. (I believe Divergent is exempted simply because back then Roth was still too inexperienced a writer to realize that the pace is something you need to pay attention to; see the irony in this?) The first part; more introductory; was made interesting by the novelty of the world and of the characters; but the second part is really tough to get through. The writing; being not particularly brilliant and; again; simply average; doesn't help much; the same applies to the plot.
â€¢In spite of everything I said so far; I found the main characters; Cyra and Akos; to be compelling enough; which definitely helped in making it to the end of the book. Ad for the rest of the cast; well; I liked the villain; but apart from these three; no one else is worth special mention.
âž½ Since that little yet so charming detail in the world-building won me over so thoroughly; and since I am genuinely curious to know how some of the dynamics established between some of the characters will play out; I will be picking the sequel up. I didn't love it; but if what you're looking for is a world for you to flee to; a story for you to relax with; then Carve the Mark is as good any. (less)",559,NEXTBOOK

I'll just get this out of the way: I hated Allegiant; but I really liked Divergent and Insurgent. This is a very different kind of book. It's sci-fi. Set in space and on other planets. The people are basically human and look and act the same as us (except for some hard to pronounce names). In this world; there is a current that runs through everything. Some people worship it; some view it in scientific terms. It gives everyone a currentgift. Healing; visions; the ability to withstand pain; the ability to give pain; etc. etc.
The story focuses on a young man and woman who belong to warring families that hate each other. One is kidnapped and taken to their enemies' land where he slowly builds a relationship with the sister of his kidnapper. There's The Evil Bad Guy. Another brother who was also kidnapped and becomes a shell of what he once was due to The Evil Bad Guy using him for his currentgift.
I went from really liking it; to liking it okay; and then I just started to get annoyed. This was boring in a lot of places. It did not need to be 500 pages long. There just wasn't enough plot to justify that. I didn't really feel anything for any of the characters. I did like the two main leads; but their romance was very meh.
The whole thing was meh. And the action at the end didn't improve anything and actually made it worse. It's like the story just ended with a lot of things unresolved. How annoying.
I have heard that some people think this book is racist? I did not see any racism in this. In fact; skin tone was rarely mentioned; and people in all the different cultures had different hair color and skin tones. I've read fantasy where ""fair-skinned"" people scarred themselves. I saw no racism. It was just an okay; mostly boring book. I'm disappointed because it seemed like it would be good. The premise was good. But there was no real meat.
It just ended up feeling really generic. I gave Roth another chance; but I am done now. This was an unsatisfying read.
Edit: Now I see it is actually the first book and another one is planned. NO THANKS! I'm good. (less)",560,NEXTBOOK

Uncensored review as always
And spoiler-free
Oh boy. This is not going to be pretty. Iâ€™m sure you have seen all the upchucked Haterade that the â€œcontroversy brigadeâ€ so generously spewed about this book before and after itâ€™s release. So obviously; I wanted to love this book SO HARD if only to shove a raving review in the face of absurdity! Unfortunately; I canâ€™t do that here.
*sulks*
On the other hand â€¦ I honestly did not see ANY of the controversy. Like â€¦ where is it? I have no idea. Iâ€™m sure some â€œhelpfulâ€ person will take the time to â€œenlightenâ€ me in the comments below (hint: donâ€™t. Because I honestly don't care). Sadly; large portions of this book were just confusing and slow. But we will start with the positives â€¦ because Iâ€™m not a complete asshole.
What I did like
The best part of this book (for me) was all the culture building Roth so intricately weaved together for this world. Some of you may find this part a bit info-dumpy â€¦ but I'm a total nerd for stuff like this so I loved it! All the fascinating religious beliefs; languages; history. Yeah â€¦ totally my jam and I ate it with a spoon and a smile. These are the things that shape a society. These are the things that create diversity; discrimination; conflict and war! These are the things that help to shape an individual (along with personal experience and learned/inherited behavior). Which brings me to another thing I loved about this book.
Roth did an incredible job building her characters from a psychological standpoint. Personal histories were laid beautifully throughout this book; making the characters intricate and intriguing and real. People are not black or white; good or bad. People are tapestries of gray with shades of every manner of influence woven through. All broken; all healing; all scared and walled and pieced in varying ways.
I could continue on this subject for a while; inevitably meandering into a major psychology lecture the likes of which we many never escape â€¦ so I shall move along. But before I dive headfirst into negativity land â€¦ I want to acknowledge the fact that; while I will not take the time to chronicle each and every moment/plot-point/collection-of-words that I liked about this book; I did enjoy the story for the most part. It truly is a good concept and story; and with a good pair of scissors in the hand of a less forgiving editor; this would have been a much more successful read.
What I did not like
What the fuck is going on?
Where are we?
What the hell is this place?
How did we get here?
What color are the walls?
This is an example of the types of questions I may have asked myself while stumbling through this book. Let's face it; the descriptions of actual places were basically non-existent. I like to fancy myself as having a pretty active imagination; but even I had major trouble visualizing scenes while reading this. Honestly; the beginning of this book really roped me in (I quite enjoyed a good portion of the first part of this book). Unfortunately; the middle dropped all form entirely and became a cluster fuck of what-the-fucks â€¦ and it didnâ€™t get any better from there. To add to the utter confusion ... I often felt like I was missing huge chunks of time. Like ... we were here ... then all the sudden weâ€™re over there ... and I had no idea why or how.
To say that a majority of this book was confusing as fuck would be an appropriate assessment. Confusing and slooooooow (and I don't mind slow but this was not a good slow). Honestly this was really my biggest and perhaps only complaint with this book. As I mentioned above; the concept and the story was actually quite decent. But when you canâ€™t focus because you are either confused or bored â€¦ a great concept really fails to hold sway. The point of fiction is to transfer your reader to another time/place/world. But in order for that to be effective; the world first has to be built. This was the utter failing of this book and unfortunately; itâ€™s a doozy.
In Conclusion
Great concept. Good plot. Poor execution. Slow and confusing. I would not recommend. (less)",563,NEXTBOOK

Carve the Mark by Veronica Roth
Book One of the Carve the Mark series
Publisher: Katherine Tegen Books
Publication Date: January 17; 2017
Rating: 3 stars
Source: ARC sent by the publisher
Summary (from Goodreads):
On a planet where violence and vengeance rule; in a galaxy where some are favored by fate; everyone develops a currentgift; a unique power meant to shape the future. While most benefit from their currentgifts; Akos and Cyra do notâ€”their gifts make them vulnerable to othersâ€™ control. Can they reclaim their gifts; their fates; and their lives; and reset the balance of power in this world?
Cyra is the sister of the brutal tyrant who rules the Shotet people. Cyraâ€™s currentgift gives her pain and powerâ€”something her brother exploits; using her to torture his enemies. But Cyra is much more than just a blade in her brotherâ€™s hand: she is resilient; quick on her feet; and smarter than he knows.
Akos is from the peace-loving nation of Thuvhe; and his loyalty to his family is limitless. Though protected by his unusual currentgift; once Akos and his brother are captured by enemy Shotet soldiers; Akos is desperate to get his brother out aliveâ€”no matter what the cost. When Akos is thrust into Cyraâ€™s world; the enmity between their countries and families seems insurmountable. They must decide to help each other to surviveâ€”or to destroy one another.
What I Liked:
Carve the Mark is absolutely worth the hype and the excitement; and it's definitely worth your time to read this book if you've been looking forward to reading it. Chances are; it won't disappoint you. In many ways; I liked this book a lot. But there were several specific things that might seem small or insignificant in the grand schemes of things; that ended up really bothering me. Hence; the three-star rating.
This story is told by two characters - Akos; a Thuvhe; and Cyra; a Shotet. The Thuvhe are a peace-loving people living on Urek. The Shotet are more aggressive nomadic people that conquer various nations and planets. When he is fourteen; Akos is captured; along with his brother; by the Shotet; who kill his father in front of him. They are taken to the Shotet stronghold of Urek; ruled by Ryzek Noavek; a ruthless tyrant and older brother of Cyra. They are stolen for their currentgifts - Akos's brother Eijeh is the next oracle of the Thuvhe. Akos grows into his currentgift - he can interrupt the current (he can cancel it out; turn it off; that sort of thing). Several years later; Akos is shaped into a warrior; but he has lost known of his humanity. He is not a killer; though he has killed to protect himself. He is brought to help Cyra Noavek; whose currentgift is inflicting pain on others with her touch. No one can touch her without feeling pain; but Akos can; because he interrupts the current (and all currentgifts are ""fueled"" by the current). Akos cooperates because he wants to rescue his brother and flee. But the more he and Cyra interact; the more they learn about each other; and the more they realize that they share common interests; interests that could incite wars.
The beginning of the book was incredibly confusing (I'll talk about that in the next section); but once I (sort of) got a grasp of the world and everything going on; I started to get into the story and really sink into it. This is science fiction; though certain elements (like the currentgifts) can definitely be categorized as fantasy. This story takes place across planets of a galaxy; so it's a space-y type of science fiction.
I must say; Roth did an excellent job with the characterization and character growth; specifically in terms of Cyra and Akos. I'll start with Akos. He is easily my favorite character of the book. He is Thuvhe; and so he is brought up to be more peaceful and somewhat passive towards violence. Even several years being trained as a Shotet soldier doesn't break him down. He is compassionate; and he is strong. I liked him a lot; especially for his unbreakable will. I was amazing and in awe of how much pain and grief and despair he bore; for years. Akos grows into a character that still hates killing; and is sick over having to kill anyone; but can do it. He becomes so strong and capable in other ways; and he's also extremely intelligent and clever. He isn't an alpha type of YA hero - he's quietly intelligent and very; very human.
Cyra is almost the opposite of him; yet it slowly becomes apparent that she has similarities to him. She appears to be a brutal; cold; emotionless killer summoned and used by her brother; Ryzek. But Cyra does not enjoy wielding her painful power over others; and she definitely does not enjoy bending to Ryzek's will. In many ways; it is Akos who shows her mercy; what mercy is; and that she is still capable of being merciful; and better; and more. Cyra learns to turn her pain into something else. She loses none of her deadliness and her danger; but as the story goes on; she becomes stronger and more able to stand up to Ryzek.
Once I got past the first one hundred pages or so; I had little difficulty getting through the story. I was pretty engrossed and despite the book being rather long; I read it quickly. There is so much happening in this story; and I wanted to see how it would all end. There were so many moments when things could go disastrously wrong; and I held my breath as I turned the pages. No one can say that certain parts of this book weren't engrossing. A lot of the story ends up being about how to unseat Ryzek; and how to stay alive and protect each other.
There is romance! I liked seeing Akos and Cyra fall for each other. It's actually Cyra who shows her feelings first; which you wouldn't expect. Cyra is supposedly the more ruthless one; and Akos is the more emotional and merciful one. But it's Cyra that starts to fall for Akos first; and shows her hand first. I liked their dynamic a lot - they learn to trust each other before anything else. No love triangle! Thank goodness for that. I thought this romance was well-developed; and swoony towards the end.
There is also another romance which I thought was sweet. I can't say much about it because it'll spoil things; but it's between two characters that are good together.
The ending; as insane and chaotic as it is; is not a cruel ending. There is no horrible cliffhanger; which is surprising; since this is book one of a duology. You'd expect something really terrible to have happened at the end; hurting the main character(s). Don't get me wrong; terrible (permanent) things definitely happened; but the ending isn't a cliffhanger; and I definitely appreciate that.
Now I'm going to talk about the things I didn't really enjoy.
What I Did Not Like:
First: the initial one hundred pages or so? Very confusing; and very boring too. I had a hard time getting through the beginning of the story. There is so much information dumped into the first couple of chapters; and so many names. It also took me a while to realize that the beginning is when Akos is fourteen - and NOT the ""present"" time of the story. Same with Cyra's beginning - she is six when her chapter begins. The beginning has too much going on; and it isn't well-explained at first. I had to reread several of the chapters a few times to really get some sort of grasp as to what was happening.
I'm not sure I really understand the world/world-building? Currentgifts and their origin and how/why they exist still kind of elude me. What is the ""current""? Where did it come from? How is it magically given people these currentgifts? The currentgifts are things like inflicting pain upon touch; or not feeling pain at all; or seeing the future; or seeing every memory of a person.
Second: there are so many awful; brutal scenes in this book. I'm talking about torture and cruel treatment of people. I understand that this type of brutality is very real and exists in real life and has a place in this fictional world; but the brutality of a lot of it... didn't sit well with me. Usually a certain level of violence doesn't bother me too much? The violence in this book; while not exactly graphic; is horrifying. Which is probably the intent; but my stomach hurt; reading it.
Third: Not the biggest thing I didn't like; but I wasn't a huge fan of having Akos's POV in third-person; and then Cyra's in first-person. I loved reading from both of their POVs! But it would have been nice to have a little uniformity (either both in first; or both in third). Also it already scares me; that Roth chooses to tell this story from both Akos and Cyra's POVs. We saw what happened in Allegiant...
Fourth: problematic racial content. Oh yeah; I definitely see where people are coming from; when they say that this book has some racist content. The Shotet are portrayed as ""brown skinned""; aggressive; nomadic people. They stole Thuvhe children years ago; and the Thuvhe retaliated and stole Shotet children; but the way the story is told; the Shotet are the ""villains"". I mean; given that the first chapter is about Akos's father getting brutally murdered in front of him; I get why that would be implication. But there are definitely underlying tones of something problematic here: the Thuvhe; light-skinned peaceful people; and the Shotet; darker-skinned aggressive people; are both cliches. And what's more; it seems like most of the Shotet have very violent currentgifts; whereas the Thuvhe have more passive; non-violent gifts (like Akos's; or his mother's; or his brother's).
Do you see the problem here? Why is it that the ""aggressive"" people are always the brown/darker-skinned ones; and the more ""peaceful"" non-violent people are lighter-skinned? I have no qualms with the characters themselves (I adore Akos; and Cyra is such a fighter); but the social construct here is reflective of cliches and stereotypes.
Read THIS peace if you want more information. I definitely do not know it all; but I recognize and understand the issue at hand here; in terms of race and culture.
Would I Recommend It:
Yes; I had issues with this book; and I firmly believe that last issue needs to be addressed. And yes; I also enjoyed the book; for the most part; regardless. It's a good story; and I was definitely swept up in the story as I was reading. I'll be reading the sequel next year. I don't know if I really should recommend this book; given the evident issues. But I did like the story too. If you've been excited to read this book; believe me; it probably won't disappoint. But... recognize issues when you see them. Talk about them. Discuss and learn.
Rating:
3 stars. Like I said; this is a good story; and of all of Roth's books; it's probably her best. I think I liked it more than I liked her other books (definitely more than I liked Insurgent and Allegiant - though I never fully read Allegiant). I want to see where the story goes. But there were some things that held me back a little; in terms of my rating. (less)",564,NEXTBOOK

I don't think the ""kill marks"" which feature in this book are okay. My friend Cait talks more about how they these marks can be connected to self harm. I was curious about this book but after hearing several quotes which feature in the book about these marks I am physically sick and disgusted. It honestly saddens me. I wonder how such a thing passed by so many ARC readers though.
The cover itself is a representation of self harm. Something that people also need to be aware of. It is not simply a wall with gold paint.
Please proceed with caution if you choose to read this book despite the triggers present. Stay safe. As soon as you feel even slightly triggered; put the book down. Your mental health and physical well being is more important than this story. Please be careful; you're all too important.
On top of all this; there are racist stereotypes and ableist attitudes all throughout this book. Something which shouldn't be supported at all; in my opinion.
Also; to tell people their opinion about the racism; ableism and triggers which feature in this book is invalid or wrong is highly ignorant behaviour . You are allowed to enjoy this book; but stay away of the problems that do feature and stay open to others opinions; especially those who have been harmed by this novel.

""Any more than you chose your fate. You and I; we've become what we were made to become.""
I feel like I could throw a dart in a bookstore and hit at least a dozen YA books with practically the same quote and premise.
The nature vs nurture debate is well-trodden ground in fiction; not just in YA. Is there such thing as fate? Are villains born or made? These are all themes that can be reinvigorated and made fresh and unique; but Carve The Mark just fails across the board.
I'm the first to admit Divergent had its problems. But at least it was fun; fast-paced; and filled a Harry Potter and the Hunger Games niche. Carve The Mark is boring. Lifeless. Take them out of space and it'd be a more standard dystopian than its comparison title Divergent. And it ends abruptly just when things are getting exciting; as though it knows it needs something to bring readers back.
There's absolutely nothing noteworthy about the main characters Cyra and Akos. They're just there; taking up space; saying their lines; running through the motions. It's a mark of how utterly blah they are that their banter falls flat. Not a single crooked grin graced my mouth while reading.
The romance is formulaic and didn't carry as much depth as it should have. Akos was captured by Cyra's people (the Shotet) as a child. Her brother ordered the murder of his father and brother. He is a prisoner falling in love with his captor; but he spends a weirdly short amount of time analyzing this.
Where's the self-loathing? I can't believe I'm asking this; but where's the angst? He accepts his feelings far too easily for someone in his position.
I personally think Ryzek; Cyra's power-hungry brother; is a far more interesting character to focus on because his currentgift allows him to swap out his own memories for someone else's. It explores the question of how much your past defines your personality. The person usually on the receiving end of these memory swaps is Akos's brother Elijah. Unfortunately; Roth insists on shining the spotlight on the boring siblings.
Finally; the chronic pain/self-harm glorification:
""The gift;"" I said; ""is the strength the curse has given me."" The new answer was a blooming hushflower; petals unfurling. ""I can bear it. I can bear pain. I can bear anything.""
For the record; the title refers to a Shotet practice where lines are carved on their arm to mark their kills. Pain is a main theme in Carve the Mark and is ultimately presented as something positive; something that helps you build character.
There has been considerable outrage over this; which you can Google. While I agree that this message has some uncomfortable implications; I sort of understand why Roth wrote it the way she did. Her religious beliefs; I personally think; shape the way she writes. It's why she ended Allegiant the way she did.
(Please note that this is pure speculation and I could be as wrong as BBC Sherlock fans who thought Mary Watson was working for Moriarty. But the English major in me won't shut up.)
Overall; I expected more. More from YA; more from an author who has an international bestseller and a film franchise under her belt.
I won't be waiting for the sequel with baited breath. (less)",567,NEXTBOOK

""The darkness was pain; and I was made of it; I was pain itself.""
TenÃ­a tantas cosas que querÃ­a debatir con ustedes; que termine sobrecargÃ¡ndome; y al final ya no soy capaz de expresarme coherentemente referente a todo lo que querÃ­a decir de este libro. Sorry amigos les he fallado; esta reseÃa es un big fat mess; al menos encaja a la perfecciÃ³n con el mess que es este libro.
Empezare esta reseÃa con 2 pequeÃas pero muy importantes declaraciones.
1-Mi reseÃa NO FUE PAGADA; yo compre mi libro como cualquier otro mortal.
2-Soy una mujer de color; soy parte de una minorÃ­a; y no me sentÃ­ ofendida o atacada por este libro.
Ahora si empezamos hablando de la historia.
Si quieren saber de quÃ© trata la historia clik aquÃ­. (view spoiler)
La historia en si es MEDIOCRE; empieza muy bien; pero el desarrollo decae mucho porque no sabemos hacia dÃ³nde va la historia; mÃ¡s de la mitad del libro nos la pasamos como en pausa con los personajes sin avanzar; solo al final tenemos un poco de acciÃ³n.
Es un conjunto de los clichÃ©s tÃ­picos del genero YA; adolescentes atractivos con la responsabilidad de salvar a todo el mundo. Se odian luego sorprendentemente resulta que ya se aman. En serio el enamoramiento no me lo creÃ­ nada; ya que nos lo cuentan; pero no lo vemos. Es como una mezcla de Divergente y Red Queen.
Se supone que es Ciencia ficciÃ³n; pero no vemos realmente la ciencia detrÃ¡s de esta galaxia. Recuerdo una escena en especÃ­fico donde la pronta ve los tanques de oxÃ­geno en la nave espacial; y en vez de decirnos un poco de cÃ³mo funciona todo; simplemente nos dice que â€œa ella nunca le ha importado aprender cÃ³mo funcionan las cosasâ€.
Hablando del racismo y estereotipos:
Llevo dÃ­as pensÃ¡ndolo y analizÃ¡ndolo; les voy a decir tal cual lo que siento y posiblemente no les agrade; posiblemente no lo entienda y eso estÃ¡ bien; no espero que todos compartan mi opiniÃ³n; en especial lo que estoy a punto de compartirles.
Como lo dije al inicio yo no me sentÃ­ ofendida o atacada por la manera en la que la autora retratara a la mujer de color.
Eso no quiere decir que no sea problemÃ¡tico; solo quiere decir que a MI no me afecto; y para eso hay una simple explicaciÃ³n. Los latinoamericanos tenemos problema para distinguir el racismo; y lo justificamos. Eso viene de aÃos y aÃos en la que el racismo se nos ha inculcado en la escuela y nuestra sociedad. En la que el mayor racismo que hemos aprendido; aplicado y seguimos repitiendo; es el racismo hacia nuestra propia raza.
Por eso la temÃ¡tica problemÃ¡tica de este libro no me parece TAN MALA; aunque si lo sea. Triste; pero cierto.
En la historia tenemos 2 pueblos:
Los Thuvhesit; descritos como caucÃ¡sicos; con cabello negro y ojos de color claro. Son amables; su lenguaje es suave y estÃ¡n acostumbrados a vivir en el clima muy frio. Su economÃ­a estÃ¡ basada en el cultivo de flores.
Los Shotet son descritos como una raza de â€œsangre de diferente colorâ€; en serio usan esa frase; (como si ser de diferente raza nos hiciera diferentes por dentro). Son fÃ­sicamente fuertes; constantemente descritos como violentos y salvajes. Al final que podemos conocer mÃ¡s nativos de shotet y no solo a los protagonistas; vemos que ese solo era un prejuicio; vemos shotet bailando; cantando y siento en general tranquilos.
Entiendo porque algunos se sintieron tan ofendidos; por lo mucho que se repite que los shotet son salvajes y violentos.
Creo que si la historia hace algo bien es mostrarnos lo fÃ¡cil que los gobiernos manipulan una sociedad; lo fÃ¡cil que es venderles el estereotipo de los enemigos.
â€œYou assume Iâ€™m brutal because thatâ€™s what youâ€™ve heard. Well; what about what Iâ€™ve heard about you? Are you thin-skinned; a coward; a fool?â€
En el libro vemos a los protagonistas darse cuenta de lo errÃ³neas que eran sus ideas del uno por el otro. Akos ve la belleza de los Shotet y aprende de sus costumbres he historias; que el ignoraba por completo.
Cyra de igual modo aprende que los Thuviest no son los villanos que ella creÃ­a; que ser amable; sincero; noble no es una desventaja; aprende mÃ¡s de su enemigo que de toda su familia.
Mala representaciÃ³n del dolor crÃ³nico:
AquÃ­ no entiendo cuÃ¡l es el enojo de la gente. La verdad el dolor de Cyra es lo mÃ¡s flojo de la historia. La escritura de VerÃ³nica se pasa de simplona; especialmente en este aspecto; nos dicen y dicen hasta el tope lo mucho que sufre Cyra; pero cuando vemos a Cyra ella anda entrenando; leyendo libros; cocinando y demÃ¡s. La historia no trasmite nada.
Sexismo:
La protagonista; es fuerte; valiente; inteligente y hermosa. Y aun asÃ­ vive sometida a los deseos y caprichos de su hermano y el protagonista es el Ãºnico capaz de apaciguar su dolor. Nos la intentan vender como una mujer sÃºper poderosa pero que de igual modo necesita de un hombre que la rescate constantemente.
Pago de reseÃas:
Hay muchos chismes al respecto; no sÃ© cuÃ¡ntos de ellos sean verdad. Al parecer la editorial le pago a varias personas para realizar reseÃas; pero cuando dichas reseÃas eran negativas la editorial se negÃ³ a pagarles he inclusive los amenazo para que publicaran sus opiniones hasta despuÃ©s de la publicaciÃ³n del libro.
Wherever si las editoriales quieren pagar y regalar libros para que los booktuvers o bloggers les hagan promociÃ³n; no me intereza. Si dichos booktubers mienten para mantener a las editoriales contentas tampoco me importa; yo no los veo; y si los veo me tomo con precauciÃ³n sus opiniones.
Si tÃº me dices que le diste una reseÃa positiva a un libro malo solo porque te pagaron; ok; cada quien hace lo que sea para vivir.
Pero no sean hipÃ³critas; sostengan lo que pusieron al inicio; sostengan sus 5 estrellotas que le dieron a este libro; antes de que desatara el escÃ¡ndalo; se retractan; pero ya para quÃ©.
En conclusiÃ³n: Era obvio que tarde o temprano alguien dirÃ­a basta. Basta de que los autores betsellers sean en su mayorÃ­a caucÃ¡sicos; basta que siempre retraten a las minorÃ­as como villanos; basta de que sus historias mediocres tengan mÃ¡s aceptaciÃ³n por las editoriales; basta de que las editoriales nos quieran manipular pagando por opiniones. Tienen razÃ³n este no es el Ãºnico libro que contiene estos tÃ³picos; pero ya era hora de que se dijera; mala suerte que le toco a VerÃ³nica Ruth.
P.D.
Si son fans de la saga Divergente y estÃ¡n dudando en empezar este libro porque tienen miedo que la autora mate al protagonista. No se preocupen; desde los primeros capÃ­tulos nos dicen que el protagonista va a morir; y tambiÃ©n nos dicen cÃ³mo. (less)",569,NEXTBOOK

I can't say for sure what drew me to this book. It's not the kind of thing I usually pick up; and I haven't read anything by Reid before. But something about it intrigued me. So I checked out the kindle sample. Just a couple chapters; I figured; because I probably wouldn't like it anyway. And I was HOOKED.
It's perfect; easy beach read material. It's not particularly deep; it does not take the genre to new levels or make you think about something new; and yet it DID feel different. Evelyn Hugo's story was so delicious and compelling that it stood out; and kept me turning pages in a desperate need to discover the stories behind her seven husbands; and the answer to the one question everyone wants to know: who was her greatest love?
The framing of the story reminded me a lot of The Thirteenth Tale. Like that book; in The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo; a young woman - this time an ambitious journalist called Monique Grant - goes to interview an elderly woman. Unlike The Thirteenth Tale; this elderly woman happens to be one of the most famous actresses in the world.
Evelyn Hugo has lived a life in the public eye; but she is full of secrets. Only she knows what happened behind the scenes in her long career of scandals and highly-publicized heartbreaks. Just like the fictional world of the book longed to know the truth-- so did I. Reid and Evelyn's habit of giving you just enough to leave you wanting more was incredibly exciting. Throughout; we are encouraged to wonder why someone like Evelyn Hugo would specifically request a relatively-inexperienced journalist like Monique. Why Monique? What is Evelyn hiding?
The more I got to know Evelyn; the more I fell in love with her. She has made a lot of controversial decisions during her career; but she knows it and she also knows she'd probably do it all again. She's played the Hollywood game; dated famous men to further her career; and used her body to get what she wants. She has experienced the full force of the industry's sexism and; in some ways; capitalized on it. She is deeply flawed and aware of it. She has traded important aspects of her identity for more fame; more roles; more money. She was a badass Cuban woman working in an industry that didn't like women to be badass or Cuban. She manipulated and she lied. Despite everything; I liked her.
I stayed fully engrossed in the story of Evelyn Hugo - and of Monique Grant - from the opening chapters when Evelyn demanded an interview with only Monique; through decades of Hollywood in all its shimmering ugliness; right until the ending's final reveals. I enjoyed every moment.

this book was so wild I feel like it fundamentally changed me as a human being. I've witnessed cosmic justice at its coldest and its darkest. I'm genuinely so tempted to go buy myself an expensive bottle of wine and drink it alone in a hammock while listening to 80s music and crying just for the drama of it all. That probably won't solve all my lifeâ€™s problems but it would certainly distracts me from them!!
so what is this book about?
Contrary to appearances; this is not the mere tale of a sultry glamourous woman with seven husbands and a tragic fame. This is the multifaceted story of a woman who's lived her whole life being two people; two images overlapping. A woman who was driven by the sheer compulsion for recognition combined with a need to charm people and shine and in that process; sheâ€™s built her own hell and heaven; solely crafted by the pure abstraction of her essence. A woman whoâ€™s got everyone to kneel before her throne unaware that it was born of lies so easily because everyoneâ€™s only ever liked the idea of her and not the reality of her.
This is her story after the mask has worn off and showed what was lurking behind it; her truth without being edited; moderated and filtered down by the time it makes it to the screen; and then given to the public to make them feel very comfortable.
This is her story 7 decades later after sheâ€™s decided it was never her job to make them feel comfortable in the first place. Evelyn Hugo no longer desires to be off on her own diva planet. She wanted to be on Earth. She wanted to be seen. She was past needing celebrity. She needed to be heard. She refuses to be trivialized for being a woman; a sex symbol; and a celebrity. She wasnâ€™t just the Cuban girl who changed her name; dyed her hair; wore the emerald green silk dresses and the accompanying chains; smiled pretty; and shut up about everything else. She was ready to talk about the void; the unhappiness underneath the smile; her age; her divorces; and all the other unglamorous things that Hollywood likes to pretend never happens to its starlets.
She is ready to declare that youth and beauty and the movies and the seven husbands were not her accomplishments. The family sheâ€™s had and lost and the woman she's so fiercely loved for almost six decades were.
They are just husbands. I am Evelyn Hugo. And anyway; I think once people know the truth; they will be much more interested in my wife.
What I loved most about this book was how passionate it was in bringing to light so many important topics.
Starting with being a woman in an industry that beholds women to its whims; its likes and dislikes; promotes them as sexual objects and loves to build a woman up before tearing her down. An industry that estimates male celebrities based on intelligence or depth; while it values female celebrities based on how sexually available they are presented for male consumption. Especially when you're a woman of color. A woman of color could never escape from race or gender when she is making art. She canâ€™t take off her color and sex and leave them at the door; and for that she's unfairly redeemed unimportant and undeserving of a storyline and character development.
This book was also single-handedly smashing the patriarchy. So buckle up.
Evelyn Hugoâ€™s story was a Call Out against the men who had cut her down way below size and built themselves up at her expense; who only used her as an attention machine to brag about their accomplishments and relieve themselves of mental durress; who only considered her a sponge that they can fill with their worries and ego and squeeze out when they please. The men who admired her confidence only when it made her fun; flirty; and comfortable in her sexuality. But the second she claimed space for herself; demonstrated high standards; a strong will; and the kind of assertiveness required to challenge them; then all of a sudden; she was a bunch of derogatory terms.
And it's honestly so real how women are continuously expected to tone down and dilute their personalities in order for them to look more appealing to men. Women are always too opinionated; too educated; too confident; too strong willed; too passionate. Women are expected to chip away at their selves to become more soft and pliable and easy to stomach and all of it is just patriarchy's last attempt to uphold power and entitlement.
This book also broached the topic of divorce and how it often means eternal shame for women. How only women are blamed when their marriages fail and ostracized when they seek to open their lives up to a quiet and peaceful independence. The media tore into Evelyn after each divorce; dragged her; burned her (metaphorically) alive; and buried her body underneath thousands of unsubstantiated celebrity gossip while her husbands remained unscathed.
People donâ€™t find it very sympathetic or endearing; a woman who puts herself first.
Prior to reading this book; I didn't know it centered a queer woman of color and that it repped lgbtq+ themes which is why I didn't pick it up sooner. I really can't emphasize enough the importance of highlighting reprensentation in books. Readers from marginalized communities; including myself; long to see themselves in fiction; to learn that they can be the heroes of their stories and to finally get to star. Queer themes and issues had a prominent presence in this historical novel and it's really important that this be mentioned in reviews and blurbs!!
You imagine a world where the two of you can go out to dinner together on a Saturday night and no one thinks twice about it. It makes you want to cry; the simplicity of it; the smallness of it. You have worked so hard for a life so grand. And now all you want are the smallest freedoms. The daily peace of loving plainly.
This book is about Evelyn Hugo being honest about her negative habits and mistakes and taking ownership of her faults and flaws. This is her demanding to be humanized after being put on a pedestal her entire life. And most importantly; this book is a reminder that no matter how glamorous other peopleâ€™s lives might look; they've had days; many days; and many days in a row where they've felt unloved and rejected and ugly and like nothing they do has a point; theyâ€™re not all that different and untouchable after all.
Overall; I really loved this book. The plot twists were incredible. I really can't recommend it highly enough!!

The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498169036l/32620332.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/photo/32620332-the-seven-husbands-of-evelyn-hugo,4.26,Taylor Jenkins Reid,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6572605.Taylor_Jenkins_Reid,Historical; Historical Fiction; Fiction; Contemporary; Romance; Adult; Womens Fiction; Chick Lit,Melanie,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3030788-melanie,https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1514836856p2/3030788.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3030788-melanie,"â€œI spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much I loved her.â€
This is one of the best books Iâ€™ve ever had the privilege to read. It is probably in the top five for best books Iâ€™ve ever read in my entire life. I have been looking for a book like this my entire life; and no combination of words Iâ€™m about to type; and youâ€™re about to read; is going to do this masterpiece justice. But I will say that Gabby; Joce; Amelie; and Elyse were all right; and Iâ€™m so happy I listened to them; because this book is worth every single ounce of hype.
And when I say that this book is lifechanging; I truly mean it. This book is sold as a historical romance; where you learn about a fictional; famous; old Hollywood actress and all her marriages. What you get is a book that stars a bisexual; Cuban woman who was never allowed to talk about the love of her life; her wife. And when I say I cried during this book; I truly mean that I probably need to buy a new copy because I was the biggest mess youâ€™ve ever seen.
â€œAnd it will be the tragedy of my life that I cannot love you enough to make you mine. That you cannot be loved enough to be anyoneâ€™s.â€
On top of this being a powerful book about race; sexuality; misogyny; and having to conform to societies norms; the true meaning I took from this book is that life is short; so damn short; and we shouldnâ€™t spend it pretending to be something we arenâ€™t. And we shouldnâ€™t spend it doing anything less than loving the people who are worthy and deserving of our love.
â€œI didnâ€™t need boys in order to feel good. And that realization gave me great power.â€
We follow Evelyn from the very start; losing her mother very young; her body developing very quickly; noticing others noticing her developing body; marrying a man so she can leave the dead-end city she grew up in; so she can become something more. Evelyn is unapologetic with her actions; and it is one of the most empowering things Iâ€™ve ever read. She plays so many more parts than the roles she is cast in. And Evelyn learns really quickly how to play each and every man she is forced to interact with; and she quickly learns what she can gain from each and every one of them; too.
This story is told from two different timelines and two different points of view. One from Monique Grant; who is a biracial (white and African-American) woman who is going through a fresh divorce and trying to make something of herself in the journalism field. And her life changes the day her editor tells her how Evelyn Hugo is demanding her; and only her; to write something for her.
â€œHeartbreak is loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.â€
The other timeline(s) are all the different times in Evelynâ€™s life; and the different seven husbands that she had; while she is recounting the events that lead her to be telling Monique this story. Evelyn has lived a very full life; and is in her late seventies now; and is finally ready to talk about her life. But the entire book we are guessing why she has chosen only Monique for this job.
â€œMake them pay you what they would pay a white man.â€
If you guys have been following my reviews; youâ€™ll probably know that I talk about found family and how important it is to me a lot; but The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is the epitome of how beautiful a found family can be. Evelyn and Harryâ€™s friendship in this was one of the most beautiful things Iâ€™ve ever read in my entire reading life.
â€œWhen you write the ending; Monique; make sure the reader understands that all I was ever really looking for was family. Make sure itâ€™s clear that I found it. Make sure they know that I am heartbroken without it.â€
And the romance? The true romance in this book is the most romantic thing I have ever read in my entire life. And you guys know Iâ€™ve read a ton of romances; but they are all lesser to this. Every single one of them canâ€™t compare with the romance in this book. I feel like every time Iâ€™ve used the word â€œperfectâ€ to describe something that wasnâ€™t the romance in this book; then I used the word wrong.
â€œPlease never forget that the sun rises and sets with your smile. At least to me it does. Youâ€™re the only thing on this planet worth worshipping.â€
How many Evelyn and Celias are there in the world? How many are still playing the role that Evelyn was forced to play? I cry for every single person who must hide who they are; and who they want to love. And this book talks about many big things in queer history; from the Stonewall riots to the disgusting Reagan administration; but life still isn't anywhere close to equal in 2018. The prejudices; the discrimination; the virus/syndrome blaming; the looks Iâ€™ve experienced holding a girlâ€™s hand while walking into a restaurant? Those are still in 2018; in the United States; but people act like none of those things exists because marriage is legalized; begrudgingly. Iâ€™m not writing this review to get on my soapbox; but I promise; we have a lot more work to do. And this book; this book lit a fire under me.
I personally identify as pansexual; but I felt like the bisexual rep in this was a tier above anything my eyes have ever seen. Seeing Evelyn love all the parts of her; and all the different parts of her love; was something so awe-inspiring. I am still so overwhelmed with feelings; but if you identify as bi or pan; this is a love letter to you; I promise.
â€œI was a lesbian when she loved me and a straight woman when she hated me.â€
This book also focuses a huge importance on motherhood throughout the entirety of this book; and then I read the acknowledgement and started weeping all over again. Taylor Jenkins Reid was able to evoke the strongest emotions from me; and I just pray that things will be different for the generation of kids being raised right now.
This was the first thing Iâ€™ve read by Taylor Jenkins Reid; but I will buy every single new thing she produces. The writing was so lyrical and addicting. I mean; I have a quote between almost every paragraph. This whole book deserves to be highlighted. The characters; well; my mind has now forever imagined that these are real people now; so there is that. The topics; themes; and discussions are beyond important. This book just makes me feel so passionately. This book is one of the most empowering pieces of literature Iâ€™ve ever consumed. And I am not the same person I was before this book.
â€œI told her every single day that her life had been the worldâ€™s greatest gift to me; that I believed I was put on earth not to make movies or wear emerald-green gowns and wave at crowds but to be her mother.â€
If you guys ever take a recommendation from me; please have it be The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Please; Iâ€™m actually begging you. I promise; this book is lifechanging; and I equally promise you that this book changed mine. There is magic between these four-hundred-pages. Pure magic. This story is addicting; enthralling; and so important. And if youâ€™re an Evelyn; in 2018; I see you; but I hope it doesnâ€™t take you as long as it took her to be happy. This will forever be one of the best books of my life; and Iâ€™ll cherish it forever.
â€œPeople think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth; when you can show yourself to them; when you stand in front of them bare and their response is â€œYouâ€™re safe with meâ€â€”thatâ€™s intimacy.â€
Trigger/Content Warnings: death of a loved one; death of a child; talk of suicide; unhealthy dieting; underage sex with an adult; abortion; talk of miscarriage; a lot of physical abuse; cheating; dunk driving; and homophobic slurs.

*5+ Stars*
Brilliant! If I could recommend only one book for 2018; THIS would be it!
THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO not only surpassed my already-lofty expectations; but knocked my proverbial socks off as it shot straight into the open arms of my favorites-shelf.
The spirit of this story mirrors its leading lady; Evelyn Hugo; in that it feels gigantic and larger~than~life. I wanted to devour this whole; yet savor it in tiny pieces so I could linger with these characters whom I grew to admire for their extraordinary strengths and unabashed weaknesses.
The exceptionally beautiful; world-renowned Evelyn Hugo spent most of her life doing whatever it took to not only become Hollywoodâ€™s most iconic female movie star; but to remain planted in the fickle grip of fame and fortune.
Evelynâ€™s now up there in years and wants to tell her story. Not the story the public knowsâ€”her real storyâ€”the one thatâ€™s flooded with glamor; betrayal; secrets and deceit; and one hell of a complicated love story so intensely authentic it dares to bare it all; even the ugly. And I was so desperately in love with this love story.
This tale is delivered through the heart and eyes of a woman who's desperate to be seen beyond her celebrity; and it takes an unflinching look at what it means to â€œmake itâ€: The pride that follows success; and the trail of guilt that lingers for all those who were trampled and used on the way to the top.
But beneath the guise of fame; Evelyn's story transcends; and its pieces resonate with all of us; as we can all see a bit of ourselves in her struggles and triumphs; love and loss; pains and pleasures.
Evelyn Hugo isnâ€™t just a brilliant fictional character; she is a bold representation of lifeâ€™s extravagant journey being stripped down to its most basic componentsâ€”i.e.; the only things that actually matter in life.
The mystery entwined in this one is taut and sophisticated as it carries the plot full circle; opening our eyes to all that is harsh and all that is sacred. I laughed; I cried; I enjoyedâ€”and my heart was overflowing with love for all of it.
Taylor Jenkins Reid masters the art of storytelling and epitomizes the value of honesty; the significance of life; and the beauty in love of all forms. Her writing is polished and engrossing; sophisticated and sharp; witty; fluid; and I can go onâ€¦but most importantly; it has a voice that carries its messages straight into the heart of the reader.
This story stole my breath from its first pages right up until its final line; which was perhaps my favorite line of the novel. To say I couldn't put this down would be an unjust understatement; because I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever truly be able to put this one down.

this book made me experience all five stages of grief and simultaneously made me feel every positive emotion in the world and I have no idea how that is possible. but listen; if you only read one book I recommend you this year; this is a good choice. âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨
The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is; yeah; about the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Seven husbands who are sometimes awful and sometimes sympathetic and sometimes somewhere in between. Ernie; who she used to get to where she is; Don; who beat her till she barely knew whether to continue; Harry; who she loved more than any of them; Max; who loves the idea of her more than he could ever love her.
But I think; despite its marketing; this book is really about Evelyn. Awful; complicated; completely lovable Evelyn. Evelyn is a flawed; compelling; brave; ambitious woman who got to where she was with teeth and claws and never gave up. She is also; and Iâ€™m not even joking; one of the most iconic characters I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. She is a woman with a lot of ambition but also one who loves and wants to be loved. She is such a good character.
This book is also fiercely and unapologetically socio-political and I love that. Evelynâ€™s story is one of being a woman in a manâ€™s world. It is one of being a Cuban woman in a white womanâ€™s world. It is one of being a bisexual woman in an era where attraction to women was demonized by the whole culture. It is one of hiding yourself for ambition; one of trying to decide which one takes precedent; one of aging; and one of never knowing whether your choices were right.
Annnnnnnd this book also has the most fucking heartbreaking romantic relationship I have had the displeasure to read about in my entire life. I donâ€™tâ€¦ I donâ€™t know if romantic relationships should be considered spoilers; butâ€¦ well; I knew going in who the actual love of Evelynâ€™s life was and it STILL WORKED FOR ME. So here it is: Evelyn Hugo and Celia St. James are one of my favorite fictional relationships; of all time; ever. These two have a complicated; flawed; at times tumultous relationship; and yet they love each other so much; always.
â€œPeople think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth; when you can show yourself to them; when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.â€
And perhaps my favorite part was the messaging around the importance of actual love in relationships; rather than just a willingness to try.
â€œYou didn't come here and tell me how much you miss me. Or how hard it has been to live without me. You said you didn't want to give up. And I don't want to give up; either. I don't want to fail at this. But that's not actually a great reason to stay together. We should have reasons why we don't want to give. It shouldn't just be that we don't want to give up. And I don't... have any.
â€œYou have never felt like my other half.â€
I know Iâ€™ve talked about a lot of specific things in the book; but I donâ€™t know exactly how to put into words what this book meant to me. You can almost feel how much Taylor Jenkins Reid felt this book. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo left me an emotional mess; but also a happy mess. All I know is I feel ruined for any other book; and I want you to be as well.

It is a favorite of the year; it will be a favorite of all time. I am wholly enchanted by The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and I will never forget how much I adore this book.
CW: adultery; domestic abuse; death/grief; homophobia/biphobia; racism
Adult fiction is not typically my cup of tea; especially a combination of historical fiction and contemporary with the amount of long flashbacks (flashbacks: ALSO NOT MY THING). I have no idea how this combination of literary elements I typically do not like consumed my entire being; but it did. Taylor Jenkins Reid is an immensely talented author. Her prose is beautiful; vivid; and descriptive. There isnâ€™t a moment throughout this story where I was bored or underwhelmed. Every second of this book is completely engaging â€“ it was a huge struggle to put the book down.
Evelyn Hugo is one of the greatest literary characters I have ever had the pleasure to read from. The exploration of her Cuban heritage and bisexuality is fascinating; especially given the era and her celebrity status. She is one of those intoxicating characters you will never be able to purge from your mind with her strong will; her independence; her strength; her cunning; and her compassion. Evelyn Hugo is unforgettable in my mind and hearing her story was one of the greatest pleasures I think I have ever experienced as a reader.
Personally; I didnâ€™t LOVE Monique; though I am always happy to see another biracial main character in literature. I appreciated her contribution to the story as I feel the book would lose some of itâ€™s strength if there was not another character for Evelyn to explain her actions and motivations to and it was just her story; but itâ€™s for that reason that I sometimes felt she was more of a plot device than an individual character. Compared to Evelyn; I just did not care for Moniqueâ€™s individual life and problems. I enjoyed seeing how Evelyn influenced her life; but her storyline was so drab compared to Evelyn.
The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is one of my favorite books OF ALL TIME. I will never forget how in love I am with this story and all the ways it has affected me. I would recommend this book to absolutely anyone who is interested in spectacular fiction novels (which should be all of you.) (less)",576,NEXTBOOK

i really dont even know where to begin. its books like this which confirm my belief that fiction will always be better than nonfiction; because it would be impossible to find a biography that could paint the story of a womans life half as well as this did. this was extraordinary; in every sense of the word. just the depth of this book was spectacular. not to mention the diversity and representation and writing quality and complex characters. everything was just outstanding.
im kind of in that shocked state right now (if you didnt already notice) where im still reeling from what i just read. a more concise and coherent review will come once i calm down from being so hyped about the brilliance of this book and can process everything.

Don't do that.â€
Let me go ahead and say that I had no idea what to expect from this book. When it first released; I remember seeing it everywhere; and I honestly didnâ€™t take any interest in it until I was told about how diverse it was. Itâ€™s full of incredible representation: youâ€™ve got bi rep; gay rep; lesbian rep; a Cuban woman; a biracial womanâ€”so when I heard about all of that; I finally decided to give it a try; and Iâ€™m so glad that I did; because whatever I thought Evelyn Hugo was about; didnâ€™t hold a candle to the experience of reading it for myself.
â€œPeople think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth; when you can show yourself to them; when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.â€
Throughout the entire book; Evelyn is more or less laying her soul bare to Monique; this reporter who sheâ€™s asked to write her life story. As this famous actress; Evelynâ€™s memories are juicy and full of drama; hidden pains and secret triumphs; and most notably; her seven marriagesâ€”not one of them having been to the hidden love of her life. Despite the descriptions she gives for judgments she received and the snippets of gossip articles laid out intermittently through the book; Evelyn isnâ€™t ashamed of herself in any way; and it creates this incredibly feminist; sex-positive atmosphere that I couldâ€™ve soaked in forever.
â€œI made it fifty-fifty. Which is about the cruelest thing you can do to someone you love; give them just enough good to make them stick through a hell of a lot of bad.â€
Despite Evelynâ€™s status as this film goddess by this point; she feels so relatable and she manages to work even the celebrity aspects of her life into this narrative that anyone could understand; as she admits to the sins she committed and the lies she told; and even to the baser things like the fact that she realized early on; no amount of fame or fortune would ever truly satisfy a successful actress like herself. She constantly owns up to selfish motives and awful behaviors; yet sheâ€™s tremendously likable; and I think thatâ€™s a fact that points to how terrific Taylor Jenkins Reidâ€™s storytelling is: because we are hearing everything through Evelynâ€™s memories; from the mouth of an elderly woman who has settled down and found peace; it makes it difficult to ever blame her for a single crime she committed.
â€œItâ€™s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false; how people can be good and bad all in one; how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.â€
Of course; Evelynâ€™s not all badâ€”she overcame circumstances that many people wouldâ€™ve simply given up under; and yet; she managed to love beautifully and to put her family first at every turn; even if the moves she made to protect them didnâ€™t always make sense on the surface. Whether itâ€™s her hidden love; or her endless commitment to her best friend; or her breathtaking adoration of her daughter; when you reach the end of the story and look back; itâ€™s easy to see that nothing mattered more to Evelyn than the people she held dear; and it makes her feel spectacularly human.
â€œItâ€™s a hard business; reconciling what the truth used to be with what the truth is now.â€
Of course; Evelyn isnâ€™t the only character whoâ€™s enjoyable in this book; underneath her memories is the story of Monique; the reporter whoâ€™s just trying to find her place in a world that doesnâ€™t like to make room for strong women; much less women of color striking out on their own. She grows so much in a short span of time; and while the circumstances of the writing process arenâ€™t always kind to her; and while sheâ€™s never really the star of the show; you canâ€™t help but root for her; tooâ€”and everyone else in this complex; layered; masterpiece of a book.
â€œYou have to find a job that makes your heart feel big instead of one that makes it feel small.â€
I feel like there is so much more that I want to say; but at the end of the day; it all boils down to one thing: The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is one of the most brilliant pieces of writing I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It sets itself so solidly apart from anything Iâ€™ve ever read that even remotely resembled it; and is probably one of the most powerful; emotional; and incredible things I have ever read. I am forever grateful for each and every one of who you encouraged me to pick it up; and for Taylor Jenkins Reid; the genius behind the pages. I cannot recommend this highly enough.

By 1955 she was in Hollywood.
Evelyn is beautiful....as tall and slim as a ballerina; with straight thick eyebrows; oversize almond shape eyes; blonde hair; ( dyed only after she arrives in Hollywood to help her get acting roles); rich; powerful; charming; and exudes a casualness and confidence that makes her all the more radiating.
This enchanting lovely woman was humble - down to earth in areas that mattered. Yes; she had seven husbands; too!
I was quickly bewitched; fully captivated by Evelyn Hugo. It was her calm wisdom - humble but direct speaking that moved me. She made a distinction about words and how they can be misleading; that made me want to SCREAM OUT AND SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT!!!!!!
There was a scene early in the book where it was very clear how one word could induce shame. Words really can hurt and paint evil pictures.... preaching...assumptions before asking.... sarcasm.....etc.
I sat and thought about all the times people have used words - not chosen them carefully - and as a result I'd feel hurt or belittled. I'm no better. I also thought about times I did the same to others. Words do hurt and damage the spirit- and the trust of relationships. Ms. Hugo; 79 year old Hollywood legend; handled those 'wrong words' with grace; correcting - teaching- inspiring her new-friend at the time while having compassion for 'herself'. Her purpose was not to hurt her friend who spoke the wrong words - but also not to allow for the misleading word to be; ""misleading"".
I started reading 'slower' ( wanting to take in every word out of Evelyn Hugo's mouth); when I realized this Hollywood notable Starlett was sincerely deserving- and worthy of the fans she has -- a celebrity to love!!!
I soon discovered this classy gorgeous woman had acute self-awareness; high levels of emotional intelligence; clearly socially aware; and relentlessly lived a full life of many experiences filled with joy and challenges.
I felt like I was given a gift - absorbing wisdom from this 79 year old woman. Her life experiences were fascinating; glamorous; scandalous and she herself was .....*extraordinary*. I was learning from this fictional character.
Monique Grant; Evelyn's new friend; 35 years old; is an unknown reporter at 'Vivant'; in Los Angeles. Evelyn wants Monique to write a book about her life story. Everyone in the journalism community- including Monique's boss; Frankie; were shocked that Evelyn asked for Monique. ONLY Monique -- or no deal at all!!! There are some complications for Monique to figure out with work--plus her husband; David just left her....( not even married a full year); but her life is about to change.
Why did Evelyn pick Monique to write her book? We wonder right away!!!
We also want to know about Evelyn's life - her husband's - and which one she loved the most. We have many questions as we take this journey-- and it's delicious- with many insightful life lessons and messages.
Intimacy - closeness - trust - and real friendship grows as Monique listens to Evelyn's life story. Monique is past the point of remaining objective. She knows how specular of a human being Evelyn is. Against all of her journalistic integrity Monique feels a full range of emotions for her.
Monique begins to feel a deep connection and love with Evelyn. There are many juicy stories that get revealed about Evelyn's past marriages; relationships; and movies she stars in; ""Father and Daughter""; ""Little Women""; and the title role in ""Anna Karenina""; however when Evelyn begins to share about her present day life......a secret door becomes unhinged. Both women will have to face the truth together.
My final words.... THIS NOVEL IS EARTH SHATTERING FABULOUS- FANTASTIC -WONDERFUL -soooooo GOOD I can barely stand it!!!!!! It's 'not' what you think it is!!!!!!
I laughed; I cried; and thankful that this book kept me cozy company while sick in bed!!!!!
Many Thanks Atria Books; Netgalley; Jamie; ( my friend who demanded I 'not' wait for the audiobook book as planned - that I RUN over to Netgalley and begged for this book and then drop everything and start reading if given the opportunity -- bless you Jamie Girl.... and last to Taylor Jenkins Reid...

Full review featured on my blog Recipe & a Read along with a recipe for Caldo Gallego soup!
My life has been broken up into two segments: before Evelyn and after.
Where do I even start with this? If all of my enthusiasm and relentless energy could be compressed into a grenade I would pull the pin out for The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and burst into a show of sparkles and champagne bubbles. I don't even know how to concisely put into words how much this book did the damn thing for me.
So do yourself a favor and learn how to grab life by the balls; dear. Don't be so tied up in trying to do the right thing when the smart thing is so painfully clear.
Evelyn Hugo. She's a magnetic; luscious; complicated and layered character beyond all reason. How Reid was able to fit such a huge personality into only 386 pages is honestly beyond me. I didn't just want to read about Evelyn; I wanted to know her. I want to bask in her greatness; revel in her strengths and ponder her weaknesses and lessons with her.
It's always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false; how people can be good and bad all in one; how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.
Evelyn Hugo. She spent her entire life working tirelessly and mercilessly to fight her way to the top of the food chain during the Golden Age of Hollywood. She's nearing the end of her life and she's finally ready to tell all about her triumphs and failures and she chooses a down-on-her-luck; little-known; surprise-to-everyone writer named Monique Grant to tell that story.
All I've ever wanted was for you to be truly mine. But you've never been mine. Not really. I've always had to settle for one piece of you. While the world gets the other half. I don't blame you. It doesn't make me stop loving you. But I can't do it. I can't do it; Evelyn. I can't live with my heart half-broken all the time.
EVELYN FREAKIN' HUGO. Her story resonated with me and spoke lessons to me I didn't even realize I needed. Evelyn simply wants what most of us do; she wants to be seen. It is an ache within in her that transcends the words on the page and nestles itself into the heart of the reader.
While this is told from Monique's POV; Evelyn is the one weaving the tale. When Monique learns that Evelyn is ready to give a tell-all interview to her and her alone we see many parallels between these two women. Monique has her own lessons to learn; her own battles to fight and Evelyn unknowingly turns into a guiding light in Monique's life.
Why; until this moment; did I not realize that the issue is my own confidence? That the root of most of my problems is that I need to be secure enough in who I am to tell anyone who doesn't like to to go fuck themselves? Why have I spent so long settling for less when I know damn well the world expects more?
It was truly effortless to love Evelyn and this cast of characters. At itâ€™s heart this is a love story; a tale of redemption and a saga of loss and heartbreak. It tackles an insane amount of timely topics with a deft and delicate hand. Reid has truly outdone herself. This book takes homophobia; racism; sexism; trauma; abuse and a whole lot more and highlights and honors the struggles of those experiencing these ugly truths of our society.
This book. Who am I now? What do I do with my life in this new stage of After Evelyn? This is easily the newest member of my favorites shelf and my new go-to recommendation for other readers. This book isn't hyped; it's properly praised for the literary masterpiece it is. I'm now facing one of the worst book hangovers of my life because I'm not ready to say goodbye to Evelyn and her story. Reid crafted Evelynâ€™s character in a way that those around her could never get enough and she did so in such a spectacularly efficient fashion that readers wont be able to either.
Evelyn always leaves you hoping you'll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.
Pick it up; I suggest this for anyone with the capability of reading or absorbing literature through any medium. I'll just be over here; weeping quietly at the beauty and magnificence that was this story. (less)",583,NEXTBOOK

â€œPeople think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth; when you can show yourself to them; when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.â€
This book is phenomenal. This book is spectacular. This book is outstanding. I have nothing negative to say about this book. It's a pure 5 star for me. I'm irrevocably astonished and astounded. I want to hug and kiss this book till I bleed. I couldn't leave it down. I just couldn't. Storytime. It's 12:36am; I have to wake up in 7 hours or so and I'm casually reading this book. I'm on page 233; 50 pages after it got amazingly good for me. And then this line makes its fucking appearance. ""I have no idea that in less than a week; Evelyn Hugo will finish her story; and I'll find out what this has all been about; and I will hate her so much that I'll be truly afraid I might kill her."" LIKE??? AFTER THIS LINE I HAD TO FINISH THIS BOOK. And I decided I would finish it. I would read more than 150 pages and finish it. So I went to my obligation the next day with 4 hours of sleep but I was happy about it. Because I knew I couldn't survive a whole day without finishing this book. I would die. This is the impact this book has had on me. Now; let's talk specifics.
Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job; no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?
Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband; David; has left her; and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography; Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.
Summoned to Evelynâ€™s Upper East Side apartment; Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s; and; of course; the seven husbands along the way. As Evelynâ€™s life unfolds through the decadesâ€”revealing a ruthless ambition; an unexpected friendship; and a great forbidden loveâ€”Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelynâ€™s story catches up with the present; it becomes clear that her life intersects with Moniqueâ€™s own in tragic and irreversible ways.
Historical fiction is my favorite genre of all time. I love it in every form; books; tv shows; movies. But not this kind of historical fiction; the Outlander and Ross Poldark kind of historical fiction. The older one; you could say. Also; historical fiction about wars and stuff; which is more recent. But I have never read something about the Old Hollywood. I have only watched movies and tv shows about it. So this was new territory for me.
I will admit; it took me about 150 pages to get fully immersed into the story. Up until that point; the book was a 4 star for me. Which is still amazing; but I didn't quite understand the hype till that point. A little after Evelyn divulges her secret love; and basically everything starts; my wig is totally snatched. I'm into the book 100%; ready to know EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING. The pace was so incredibly fast; there was not a moment I felt my eyes close. The writing was impeccable; some narrations of scenes kept my heart racing. There weren't any redundant descriptions of places or rooms; there were descriptions of faces and clothes which kept me enthralled into to the story. The author did an amazing research; it was obvious that she knew her shit; everything was on point. The story kept me on my toes each time with its smart maneuvers; the schemes; the plans; everything the main characters did; all the choices they made; to dodge unfortunate situations. Everything was just... on point. I have nothing bad to say. This never happens. This book was just too perfect. I want to cry because; if not for the hype; I wouldn't have picked up this book. And I would have lost such an amazing journey; such an important book. Thank you all for loving this book and making me love it too.
Evelyn. Evelyn Hugo is the most flawlessly written character I have ever witnessed. No; wrong. She isn't a character to me. She is a person. With influences from Merilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor; the author made Evelyn Hugo her own star. Every time I would read about a scene from one of the movies; I was like ""Oh; I will watch that movie next.""; and then I remembered that she doesn't actually exist. Which made me sad; because all of the content of this book was so interesting. I felt like I was reading an actual autobiography from a real legendary actress. It was incredible. Evelyn is such a good written character; a good written character; not a good person. She is raw; devious; manipulative; scheming; cold-hearted. She is basically a bitch. But you can't help but to want to know everything about her. You want to slap the shit out of her one moment and then hug her the next. She is sensual; enticing; seductive. She always knows what to say to make you believe in her cause. She uses her greatest assets to her benefit; and she isn't ashamed about it. She doesn't give a fuck. She wants to climb the ladder and she will do anything to achieve her goal. Even marry seven men who will serve her purpose. And she does it. With her scandalous life and her improved acting skills and beneficial movie choices; she climbs to the top. But we also see her sensitive side; her human side. We see her deep friendship with Harry; another remarkable character. We see her love for her child. We see her devotion to Celia. We see her as a human too; with real emotions. And I find that marvelous. I wish all characters in books had so much depth; so much meaning. And not the John Green kind of pretentious deep meaning. The real one.
Monique. An underdeveloped character; in my opinion. I didn't care that much about her; but her story was gripping. To be honest; Evelyn didn't let me care a lot about any other character. She took my attention all to herself. Which is what she did with the entire world. But anyway. An unknown journalist requested to write one of the most popular actresses' biography. A 35 year old woman; who feels like she hasn't achieved much so far in her life. She has a ruined marriage; an under prestigious job; she has been under appreciated all her life; even though she possesses many skills. She is also a POC; and she is mislabeled literally every day. I needed more of her character; I needed to see more of her. But after Evelyn's story started; we didn't get much of her. But I'm so happy that she stood up to herself and her self love grew. That Evelyn showed her the way; and she got out of a meaningless marriage; she made deals regarding her job; her future; she stood on her own two feet. I'm really proud of her.
THE REPRESENTATION. THIS BOOK HAD THE BEST REPRESENTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN. Suck it all of you who keep saying a historian fiction can't entail good representation. IN YOUR FACES. We have two main interracial characters. One bisexual character; one lesbian character and one gay character. And these are just the main character. We also got side representation; from not as important characters in the story. This factor upped the story so much to me. We got to see the struggles that POV and gay people used to face in a time like this. We got to see our main character hide her true lineage to rise at the top of Hollywood. We got to see two lovers hiding their true sexuality; hiding their undying love for each other because the world would never understand. The conversations between the characters about homophobia of that time period were heartbreaking. I saw so much of our own time in them. So many things have changed since then in our world; and so many have not. We can see the comparisons from these types of books. And it's a reminder of how our society is moving forward of backwards. The representation made this book what it is. If every single character was white and straight; I wouldn't have been as awed by this book as I am now. And I am myself; a while straight female. Imagine how important representation is for people who can actually relate to it. I would never understand.
This book had so many layers. Everything was thought of and processed. Nothing was sloppy; nothing was lacking meaning. Every single word had its reason to be written. I feel privileged to have had the honor of reading this book. It will stick to me for a very long time. I also enjoyed the little snippets we got from the newspapers. They made the setting all the much more real. The relationships were everything; the friendships; the love stories. Evelyn's life is so engaging and complicated; you can't get enough of it. We truly see how corrupt the Old Hollywood was. And it makes us think about the New Hollywood. Is it still like this? Is everything we see just a fabricated lie? All the lies the characters came up with; seemed to work. I guess; we can never know what happens between closed doors. But I think the New Hollywood is more sincere. It's more about talent; at the most part. I'd like to hope so.
In conclusion; I could rave about this book for days. I have so much to say; I could write a book myself. But I'm gonna end it here. This book was a present sent to me by God himself. I want to read it again and again and again and absorb its wisdom. This book would be such an amazing source material for a movie adaptation. WE NEED THIS TO HAPPEN. But I'm scared they would ruin it. I'm always scared with book to movie adaptations. We all readers are. Anyway; I couldn't recommend this enough. It doesn't matter if you don't read historical fiction or adult; PICK THIS BOOK UP. You won't regret it one bit. So; till the next one... K BYE!!! (less)",584,NEXTBOOK

A story so well written I had to remind myself it was a work of fiction.
The cleverly titled novel appealed to my interest in old Hollywood; the scandals and cover-ups the public never had the slightest clue existed.
Evelyn Hugo is a faded movie star in advanced years who has decided to write her life story- a deliciously scandalous tell all with a sharp focus on her seven marriages.
To help with this task; she lures Monique Grant to her home under false pretenses; but soon seduces her into agreeing to take the job; by making her an offer she couldnâ€™t resist.
The story moves slowly at first while Evelyn settles into her story and Monique learns how to handle Evelyn; often using Evelynâ€™s own advice against her to gain leverage.
But; once they have come to an understanding; Evelynâ€™s story takes center stage and what a story it was.
The first question Monique asked Evelyn is:
â€Who was the great love of your life?'
It seems like a reasonable enough question; considering Evelynâ€™s numerous marriages; but it turns out to be much more complicated than what it may seem on the surface.
I admit; I sat literally spellbound and mesmerized by Evelyn and her turbulent life as an actress and movie star; and the amazing twists and turns her life took in search of personal peace; love; and contentment. Her storytelling was an Academy Award performance.
Evelyn made concessions along the way to fame; allowing herself to be recreated by erasing her Cuban heritage and features; as well as leaving her first husband for a chance at fame and fortune.
Her love life takes many twists and turns as does her career; but what the public witnessed was nothing at all like what went on behind closed doors. Her life was like the old Hollywood is all â€smoke and mirrorsâ€™ adage personified.
While Monique is the interviewer; her life and background deserves a close look. She is depressed over her failed marriage and her seemingly dead -end position at work. This gig is worth the incredible risk she takes; but she could never have guessed the monumental impact Evelyn Hugo would have on her life.
Naturally; I thought of Elizabeth Taylor and her many marriages; but the story also had a hint of Marilyn Monroeâ€™s humble beginnings as well. However; a few of Evelyn's leading men mimicked or could have been modeled after real movie stars from that era as well.
But; the most significant points come from the relationships Evelyn developed; outside of the public eye; and how they managed to keep the situation a secret for so many years.
Each husband is given their own chapter with a special title that applies to them personally or to Evelynâ€™s relationship or opinion of them.
I disliked many of them; and really loved others; as did Evelyn. But beware of Evelynâ€™s spin on things. She is determined to tell this tale her way and her outlook is often a matter of perspective.
As things progress; I began to see how Evelynâ€™s influence on Monique begins to take hold. She gives good advice even if it sounds selfish; greedy; or cold. She didnâ€™t get to be the great â€Evelyn Hugoâ€™ without some verve.
Although there are strong passages regarding sexuality; and the hidden secret lives people were forced to resort to in those days; for me; the powerful transformation Monique undergoes under Evelynâ€™s tutelage is what sticks with me the most.
Now; this story could have worked as a fictional tell all from Hollywoodâ€™s golden age; but there are a couple of 'Fasten your seatbelts; it's going to be a bumpy night'moments you wonâ€™t see it coming; which left me utterly speechless and completely flabbergasted. My emotions exploded in a million different directions at that point.
The conclusion is riddled with rich bittersweet irony; but couldn't have been more fitting.
Overall; this is an incredibly well written story; very atmospheric; multi-layered; thought provoking; and utterly hypnotizing. Someday; I would like to re-read this one so I can absorb all those nuances I missed leading up to that stunning conclusion.
This one was so good I had a little book hangover for a couple of days. Highly recommend!! (less)",585,NEXTBOOK

This has been one of the most well developed; character driven stories that Iâ€™ve read. Itâ€™s the type thatâ€™ll leave a mark and I thoroughly enjoyed my reading experience.
Throughout the course of this book; I became enamoured with Evelyn Hugo. She isnâ€™t likeable; but I fell in love her. The whole story felt real. As if I could google one of her movies; and Iâ€™d be able to start watching it right away. I was dazzled by her beauty; her bravado. I fell in love with her personality; her ugliness and facade of a life she lived for a while; and how accepting she became of the mistakes she made.
She learned from it. This is what you call learning from your mistakes. She didnâ€™t drown in regret; berate herself to the point where one can break oneself down. She dealt with her circumstances in the best way she could back then. She dealt with the cards that she was given in a way that made sense to her alone; but doesnâ€™t condone it either. However; it was her truth and she was unapologetic. There was so much strength in her character that seeped into me.
(And Hollywood is just fuckinâ€™ dirty.)
I also love the title of this book. I think anyoneâ€™s initial reaction is to be slightly shocked. I mean; I believed it. Evelyn Hugo really did marry seven men. But this story highlights that there is always more to someone than what meets the eye and what others may perceive. I donâ€™t care how strong you are in your assumption towards someone. Itâ€™s an assumption; a so-called opinion and itâ€™s flimsy at the of the day. The truth is that people are more complex; more layered and human.
I think what I was missing though was the same type of intensity that I was feeling whilst reading the first half of the story - though I donâ€™t know how much importance I should place on the â€missing intensityâ€™. But I also wished that the plot twist was looked at with more depth. It felt like the story ended almost abruptly once that reveal was made and I needed it to be more fleshed out and come round full circle.
But other than that; Evelyn Hugo; you are an icon.

Folks; this book just came into my home and murdered me personally Iâ€™m shaking
So; I literally cried for 20 minutes when listening this and not like cute little sniffles either I mean full on tears streaming down my face heaving sobs crying I'm talking having to keep wiping your eyes so you can see. I rarely get truly emotional in books so the fact this book drew that reaction from me is a testament to how fucking damn good it is. Like; please believe the hype people
Like genuinely; I 100% believe if the fucking bus I was on had just HIT ME that would have been less painful then what happened in the last 20% of this book
anyway; it's like day 8 of trying to write this review but I keep restarting it because I don't know how to communicate how much I just loved this book so much but here goes.
â€œItâ€™s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false; how people can be good and bad all in one; how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.â€
this is one of those books that you don't think you'll love so much and then it just surprises you and immediately steals your heart.
â­ it's so hard to explain what this book is about because it's so; so much more than I ever expected
On the basic level; it follows Monique; an up and coming journalist who has been invited to write a tell-all about the life of Evelyn Hugo. Evelyn Hugo is a retired Old Hollywood actress; fashion icon; sex symbol and known for her glamorous and scandalous life that included seven different marriages.
Evelyn Hugo hasn't done an interview in decades but she insists that Monique write the tell-all and so the story is told both in flashbacks as Evelyn recounts her life through the seven marriages and current time as Monique tries to unravel why Evelyn Hugo; potentially the worlds most famous actress; wants her of all people to write this tell all.
And listen; there is so; so much more happening then that but it's so; SO hard to explain. You just have to read it and trust me. Seriously I'm begging you; I'll go full Rumpelstiltskin and trade my first born for everyone to read this book because it is seriously incredible.
â€œPeople think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth; when you can show yourself to them; when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.â€
I think one thing that is so amazing about this is how real it is even though all these characters are fictitious they feel SO REAL. They're so well developed and nuanced. Evelyn Hugo; Harry Cameron; Celia St James and the other characters who appear are incredibly flawed and did some questionable things (especially Evelyn) and I loved that about it so much. The depth that Taylor Jenkins Reid gave these characters made them feel so; so alive. And it also made the pain I felt at their struggles and their joys that much more real.
This book absolutely broke me because I was SO; SO invested in these characters. I care about each one of them so much and even though eight days later I MISS them like they're real. I keep wondering what they're up to and how they're feeling. Because Taylor Jenkins Reid sets this book right in the heart of the old Hollywood era; and makes them so compelling and realistic; it honestly feels like they're real actresses and actors and producers and I have to keep reminding myself they're not. That sounds literally ridiculous but thats how WELL WRITTEN these characters are.
â€œDon't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.â€
despite the hetero sounding title; this book is very gay a large portion of this is about Evelyn Hugo explaining her love and on/off relationship with fellow actress Celia St. James. And oh my god; I love them so much. And I loved the representation so much.
I've mentioned I'm queer here before and this book really had me thinking. The book explores a little what it was like to be queer in Hollywood in this era and what it cost both Evelyn and Harry to hide their relationships. The incorporation of events like the Stonewall riots and the AIDs crisis; and showing how the community reacted to that; was upsetting but important. And it really highlighted how hard it was to be gay or bi or lesbian like these characters at the time. I think that was just something really important in this book and again; brought it up a level from a regular literary fiction book to something a bit more.
I also just really loved the bisexual rep. Like; a lot. So many things Evelyn said really hit home for me; and the tensions betwene her and Celia were really relatable because I've experienced that that too. This is not OwnVoices but I did read an article in which Taylor Jenkins Reid explained her research; and you can definitely tell she took her time to gather first person experience; read memoirs and generally research to make sure she was doing this right and she did it SO RIGHT. This is probably one of my favourite lgbtq+ books of all time
â€œBut I like you this way. I like you impure and scrappy and formidable. I like the Evelyn Hugo who sees the world for what it is and then goes out there and wrestles what she wants out of it. So; you know; put whatever label you want on it; just don't change. That would be the real tragedy.â€
Okay; I'm getting emotional again so lets leave it here. I love these messy; beautiful characters so much and I just ..... my heart is exploding thinking about all the HAPPINESS they deserved.
If you think this book is something you won't like; I did too. I thought there was no way I would care about a literary fiction book focussing on Hollywood but OH. MY. gOD. It's so much more than you think it is and it truly both made and broke my heart. this is one of my favourite 2018 reads and also a new all time favourite; and I am so; so happy it exists.

Don't read this book on your period. Just don't. Take my advice. Spare yourself the grief and agony.
Every time I closed this book and my brain snapped back to the present; it took me a couple of seconds to remember that Evelyn isnâ€™t a real person. A fictional biography is such a genius idea; and it was done so expertly. I have zero interest in movies or Hollywood (cite literally any tweet about me hating watching movies and not caring about actors); but this book and the setting and characters enchanted me. I wanted to turn on La Vie En Rose in the background as I read it just to get in the Mood.
This is the first book Iâ€™ve read in a while where I sat and read without touching my phone for 2+ hours; praying that time would pass slower so I could fit in more pages before I had to go to sleep. Part of why I was so addicted is because the writing of this book just demands attention. Itâ€™s flowing almost to the point of conversational; more like a memoir than a novel. And although I flew through the prose; part of me questions whether the flashback sections resemble the tone and voice of an older Hollywood star. A lot of the lingo and style of relating a story seemed modern; and maybe Iâ€™m just overthinking; but it took away a bit from the authenticity of the story for me. Maybe it would have worked better being told in third person as if it were Monique's writing; but something about the voice of Evelyn's memories didn't sit right with me.
I like how this book uses the perspective of hindsight. Evelyn using her wisdom to call out when she was being mistreated and all the unjust and toxic things that occurred to her constructed a powerful narrative. I applaud this book talking about feminism; abusive relationships; abortions; and bisexual erasure; among plenty other things. I can see why it's highly praised in that respect. The discussion of moral greyness and the corruption and scheming of Hollywood and fame and unabashed conceit and fame was also fascinating. I love the light in which it was painted. It was very take it or leave it; which was so different because usually; books do the most to try and convince you of a character being starkly good or bad. This book let you assume whatever you wanted to about the characters; which I respected.
Lastly; the most satisfying thing about this book is watching the growth of Monique alongside Evelyn telling her story. Being honest; I didn't think I was going to like Evelyn at first; but I realized the same quality that makes her a rude and off-putting character also makes her powerful and memorable. I grew to love her snark and confrontational dialogue; even though I would likely be terrified of her in person.
It's hard to wrap up this review because I want to say that I loved it as much as everyone else; but I can't quite put my finger on why it wasn't a full five stars. Still; I highly recommend it. (less)",590,NEXTBOOK

me: Wha..What do you mean? But she's real! She has blond hair and dark eyebrows; she's ruthless yet kind; she can't be a fictional character!

The seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo is not the story of a beautiful actress who stood the test of time. It's a story of love in all its different shades. Its ugliness and its beauty. And all that is in between.
Rating: 4;75 stars
It's safe to say that I loved this book. How can I not love this? It's like watching a beautiful black and white movie where every character is complex; painfully human and most importantly NOT STRAIGHT.
After hating so many hyped books lately; I'm happy to say that: The hype is deserved! It's even deserving of more hype. I loved how beautiful this book was and I'm not talking about the writing. It's the sadness and pain that brings this book to life and even more than that: The Characters.
Evelyn Hugo is ready to bare it all in this book. I wanted to take all the secrets she revealed; keep them close to my chest and protect them from this ugly reality. She's complex. She's cruel. She's passionate. She's human. And if you don't understand all of her. You don't desreve to love her. And God Did I fall head over heels for her! She's hands down: The best female character I've ever read about.
On her way to fame; she lost so much of herself. Hurt so many people. And she's completly unapologetic. Married seven guys yet loved only one person. Someone she wasn't allowed to have. But who she loved anyway. If love is the only word to express what they felt for each other than that's what we will call it; even if it was so much more.
Harry; her best friend is my spirit animal. Celia; with all of her passion is someone I would've loved to get to know.
I loved every character except for: Monique. The journalist. If she's a journalist I should be an author by now. How can someone be so stupid; is beyond me.
This book will break you in all the right ways. But you will be happy that you've read something so beautiful.
I definitely recommend this to everyone.
Thank you for reading this review! and I hope you have an amazing life. (less)",593,NEXTBOOK

No doubt...5/5 stars...
Read from start to finish and reviewed in one day; if that doesn't say everything I don't know what will. This review will probably just be a load of rambling nonsense as I'm writing it straight after finishing the book and I'm overwhelmed with what I've just read.
I loved everything about this wonderful story; the well developed characters; the juicy plot; the interesting way in which it was written and the twist that I never saw coming- all of this from the very start had me totally hooked. To be totally honest; I picked this up because I wanted some light hearted chic lit and whoa did I get way more than I bargained for.
I think what hit me the most about this book was how much I felt for every character in it and the relationships that Evelyn built with them. The different types of connections and love you can feel for others really resonated and the characters just felt so real to me. I think maybe after everything Evelyn Hugo did throughout her life; we should feel some kind of animosity towards her; however I cannot help but absolutely adore her and everything she did for herself and others.
The entire story from start to finish was so captivating; juicy and dramatic that I managed to finish it in one day as it completely consumed me and I wasn't able to do anything else all day. I loved the way there were articles and reports about Evelyn throughout her career entwined in the story; it really added to the way the story was delivered. I loved the way sexuality was addressed with such raw honesty and transparency and gave some insight into just how far people will go for the people they love.
The ending to the book was just beautiful and brought all the tears. This may be my favourite book of 2018 so far. A book I can say is actually worth all the hype that is surrounding it and my heart feels a lot more full right now. What a stunning book.

I had been meaning to read it since it was published last year; but something else always popped up in front of it; until I decided I needed to see what everyone was raving about. And boy; did I ever!!
Evelyn Hugo is a film legend. She is an Academy Award-winning actress; a philanthropist; a fashion icon; and; at her heyday; was one of the most stunningly beautiful women in the world. She retired from film in the late 1980s and mostly stayed out of the spotlight; enduring her share of tragedies. But her mystique still lingers.
When she decides to auction off some of her most iconic gowns to raise funds for charity; Evelyn also decides it's time to give an interview. She chooses to tell her story to Vivant magazine; but demands that a reasonably unknown reporter; Monique Grant; be the one to interview her. No one; Monique included; understands why Evelyn has chosen her; but the actress is utterly unwavering in her demand.
When Monique meets Evelyn; she is dazzled by her beauty; but is moved by her strength and her kindness. Evelyn isn't actually interested in giving an interview to Vivantâ€”she wants Monique to write her biography; publishable after her death; and wants Monique to make a fortune once it's time to make a publishing deal. Although she can't figure out why Evelyn would give this prize to her; and she knows it could endanger her job; Monique jumps at the chance to hear the legend's life story in her own words.
""When you're given an opportunity to change your life; be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things; you take things. If you learn one thing from me; it should probably be that.""
In Evelyn's luxurious Manhattan penthouse apartment; she begins unfurling her rise to fame; from growing up in Hell's Kitchen in the 1950s to making her way to Hollywood; from getting her start in movies to her decision to leave acting 30+ years later. Of course; she lays bare the stories behind her seven marriages and the men she took into her life; and the scandals; happy moments; and pain that accompanied those relationships.
Evelyn gives Monique the unvarnished truth and doesn't want to be portrayed as a good personâ€”she knows she was ruthlessly ambitious; hurtful; calculating; and unwavering in getting what she wanted. But at one point; she was the highest paid actress in Hollywood; and her intelligence and ambition helped get her there.
As Monique listens to Evelyn's story; and is moved by the complexities of her emotions; she has her own emotional challenges to figure out as well. And as Evelyn's journey helps shape her own decisions; she still wonders why the actress chose her. But Evelyn also helps change Monique's frame of reference in certain ways; how she thinks of situations and people.
""It's always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false; how people can be good and bad all in one; how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.""
The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is compulsively readable; like one of those television miniseries you can't stop watching. I'm a huge movie fan and love reading stories of ""old Hollywood;"" and Reid captures that mood and environment so perfectly. But this is more than a soapy melodramaâ€”this is a book with surprising depth; thought-provoking in the subjects it touches on; and unapologetic in its portrayal of what women needed to do to succeed in Hollywood.
Reid is an amazing storyteller. I know many have spoken highly of her earlier books and I'm going to have to check those out. But this book was fantastic from start to finish. I devoured the whole book in just a few hours because I couldn't get enough of it; but of course; I'm sad now that it's over. This was a terrific story of love; loss; self-reliance; and the struggle of being true to yourself and having to adhere to the roles society puts you in.
Pick this one up!

So here is a little secret.....when I travel via plane; I make a b-line to the sundries shops in the airports to read the 'rag' magazines. I will stand in there and read a bunch of them cover to cover. I love it. Something about those juicy stories that you think 'they can't be true; right'; something about getting the glimpse of the stars and the outrageous stories; it's a guilty pleasure. Reading this one by Talylor Jenkins Reid; gave me that same wonderful; guilty pleasure feeling. But this one; I enjoyed so much more.
This was my first Traveling Sister Group Read and it was so much fun discussing this one with everyone. Here you learn the life story of starlet Evelyn Hugo. From when she was very young living in NYC; to making her move to Hollywood; and through her yes; seven husbands. It was quite the scandalous read. When I saw early review of this one; I was hooked. And that cover...gorgeous. I don't want to say too much other than to read this one. It truly was a great read that kept me enthralled the entire time. I listened while on the exercise bike and just didn't want to get off; I wanted to keep listening. The audio was very good; winning an ear phones award; and the voice of Evelyn just drew me in like she was talking to me. Not normally the type of book I read. But every now and then; you need a juicy story; that almost borders on 'chick lit'. (Is that wrong to say?) So glad I read this one.
