    <p> Notice when you click the links on this page what happens to the URLs at the top of the page. </p>
    <p> Hopefully you see that the only stuff changing comes after what's known as the hash bang (#!). </p>
    <p> Parameters after the hash bang are used by AngularJS to route you to certain views (like the book list or book detail). </p>
    <p> You can look at app.config.js to see where we tell AngularJS which URL corresponds to which view. </p>
